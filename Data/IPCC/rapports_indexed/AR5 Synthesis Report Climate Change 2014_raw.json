    "cleaned_text": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide an authoritative international assessment of the scientiﬁc aspects of climate change, based on the most recent scientiﬁc, technical and socio-economic information published worldwide. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes, impacts and possible response strategies to climate change are the most comprehensive and up-to-date reports available on the subject, and form the standard reference for all concerned with climate change in academia, government and industry worldwide. This Synthesis Report is the fourth element of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2013/2014. More than 800 international experts assessed climate change in this Fifth Assessment Report. The three Working Group contributions are available from the Cambridge University Press: Climate Change 2013 – The Physical Science Basis Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (ISBN 9781107661820 paperback; ISBN 9781107057999 hardback) Climate Change 2014 – Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (Part A: ISBN 9781107641655 paperback; ISBN 9781107058071 hardback) (Part B: ISBN 9781107683860 paperback; ISBN 9781107058163 hardback) Climate Change 2014 – Mitigation of Climate Change Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (ISBN 9781107654815 paperback; ISBN 9781107058217 hardback) Climate Change 2014 – Synthesis Report is based on the assessments carried out by the three Working Groups of the IPCC and written by a dedicated Core Writing Team of authors. It provides an integrated assessment of climate change and addresses the following topics: • Observed changes and their causes • Future climate changes, risks and impacts • Future pathways for adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development • Adaptation and mitigation Foreword The Synthesis Report (SYR) distils and integrates the findings of the three Working Group contributions to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the most comprehensive assessment of climate change undertaken thus far by the IPCC: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis; Cli- mate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability; and Clima- te Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. The SYR also incorpo- rates the findings of two Special Reports on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (2011) and on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (2011). The SYR confirms that human influence on the climate system is clear and growing, with impacts observed across all continents and oceans. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The IPCC is now 95 percent certain that humans are the main cause of current global warming. In addition, the SYR finds that the more human activities disrupt the climate, the greater the risks of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems, and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system. The SYR highlights that we have the means to limit climate change and its risks, with many solutions that allow for continued economic and human development. However, stabilizing temperature increase to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels will require an urgent and fundamental departure from business as usual. Moreover, the longer we wait to take action, the more it will cost and the greater the technologi- cal, economic, social and institutional challenges we will face. These and the other findings of the SYR have undoubtedly and consi- derably enhanced our understanding of some of the most critical issues in relation to climate change: the role of greenhouse gas emissions; the severity of potential risks and impacts, especially for the least develo- ped countries and vulnerable communities, given their limited ability to cope; and the options available to us and their underlying require- ments to ensure that the effects of climate change remain manageable. As such, the SYR calls for the urgent attention of both policymakers and citizens of the world to tackle this challenge. The timing of the SYR, which was released on 2nd November 2014 in Copenhagen, was crucial. Policymakers met in December 2014 in Lima at the 20th Conference of Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to prepare the groundwork for the 21st Session in 2015 in Paris, when they have been tasked with concluding a new agreement to deal with climate change. It is our hope that the scientific findings of the SYR will be the basis of their motivation to find the way to a global agreement which can keep cli- mate change to a manageable level, as the SYR gives us the knowledge to make informed choices, and enhances our vital understanding of the rationale for action – and the serious implications of inaction. Ignorance can no longer be an excuse for tergiversation. and objective scientific and technical assessments in this field. Begin- ning in 1990, this series of IPCC Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, Methodology Reports and other products have become standard works of reference. F o r e w o r d The SYR was made possible thanks to the voluntary work, dedication and commitment of thousands of experts and scientists from around the globe, representing a range of views and disciplines. We would like to express our deep gratitude to all the members of the Core Wri- ting Team of the SYR, members of the Extended Writing Team, and the Review Editors, all of whom enthusiastically took on the huge chal- lenge of producing an outstanding SYR on top of the other tasks they had already committed to during the AR5 cycle. We would also like to thank the staff of the Technical Support Unit of the SYR and the IPCC Secretariat for their dedication in organizing the production of this IPCC report. We also wish to acknowledge and thank the governments of the IPCC member countries for their support of scientists in developing this report, and for their contributions to the IPCC Trust Fund to provide the essentials for participation of experts from developing countries and countries with economies in transition. We would like to express our appreciation to the government of Wallonia (Belgium) for hosting the Scoping Meeting of the SYR, to the governments of Norway, the Netherlands, Germany and Malaysia for hosting drafting sessions of the SYR, and to the government of Denmark for hosting the 40th Session of the IPCC where the SYR was approved. The generous financial support from the governments of Norway and the Netherlands, from the Korea Energy Economics Institute, and the in-kind support by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and The Energy and Resources Insti- tute, New Delhi (India), enabled the smooth operation of the Technical Support Unit of the SYR. This is gratefully acknowledged. We would particularly like to express our thanks to Dr Rajendra K. Pachauri, Chairman of the IPCC, for his leadership and constant gui- dance throughout the production of this report. Michel Jarraud Secretary General World Meteorological Organization As an intergovernmental body jointly established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environ- ment Programme (UNEP), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has provided policymakers with the most authoritative Achim Steiner Executive Director United Nations Environmental Programme v Preface The Synthesis Report (SYR), constituting the final product of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is published under the title Climate Change 2014. This report distils, synthesizes and integrates the key findings of the three Working Group contributions – The Physical Science Basis, Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability and Mitigation of Climate Change – to the AR5 in a concise document for the benefit of decision makers in the government, the private sector as well as the public at large. The SYR also draws on the findings of the two Special Reports brought out in 2011 dealing with Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation, and Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation. The SYR, therefore, is a compre- hensive up-to-date compilation of assessments dealing with climate change, based on the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic literature in the field. Scope of the Report This document is the result of coordinated and carefully connected cross Working Group efforts to ensure coherent and comprehensive information on various aspects related to climate change. This SYR includes a consistent evaluation and assessment of uncertainties and risks; integrated costing and economic analysis; regional aspects; changes, impacts and responses related to water and earth systems, the carbon cycle including ocean acidification, cryosphere and sea level rise; as well as treatment of mitigation and adaptation options within the framework of sustainable development. Through the entire length of the SYR, information is also provided relevant to Article 2, the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Other aspects of climate change covered in this report include direct impacts of climate change on natural systems as well as both direct and indirect impacts on human systems, such as human health, food security and security of societal conditions. By embedding climate change risk and issues of adaptation and mitigation within the frame- work of sustainable development, the SYR also highlights the fact that nearly all systems on this planet would be affected by the impacts of a changing climate, and that it is not possible to draw boundaries around climate change, its associated risks and impacts on the one hand and on the other, development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future gene- rations to meet their own needs. The Report, therefore, also focuses on connections between these aspects and provides information on how climate change overlaps with and mainstreams into other deve- lopmental issues. Structure The Report comprises a Summary for Policymakers (SPM) and a longer report from which the SPM is derived, as well as annexes. Even though the SPM follows a structure and sequence similar to that in the longer report, some specific issues covered under more than one topic of the longer report are summarized in one particular section of the SPM. Each paragraph of the SPM contains references to the respective text in the longer report. In turn, the latter contains extensive references to relevant chapters of the underlying Working Group Reports or the two Special Reports mentioned above. The SYR is essentially self-contained, and its SPM includes the most policy relevant material drawn from the longer report and the entire AR5. All the three contributions to the AR5 including each Summary for Policymakers, each Technical Summary, frequently asked questions as well as the Synthesis Report in all official UN languages are available online on the IPCC website and in electronic offline versions. In these electronic versions, references in the SYR to relevant parts of the under- lying material are provided as hyperlinks, thereby enabling the reader to easily find further scientific, technical and socio-economic information. A user guide, glossary of terms used and listing of acronyms, authors, Review Editors and Expert Reviewers are provided in the annexes to this report. To facilitate access to the findings of the SYR for a wide readership and to enhance their usability for stakeholders, each section of the SPM carries highlighted headline statements. Taken together, these 21 headline statements provide an overarching summary in simple and completely non-technical language for easy assimilation by readers from different walks of life. These headline statements have been craf- ted by the authors of the Report, and approved by the member gover- nments of the IPCC. The longer report is structured around four topic headings as manda- ted by the Panel: Observed changes and their causes (Topic 1) integrates new information from the three Working Groups on observed changes in the climate system, including changes in the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere and sea level; recent and past drivers and human influences affecting emis- sion drivers; observed impacts, including changes in extreme weather and climate events; and attribution of climate changes and impacts. Future climate changes, risks and impacts (Topic 2) presents informa- tion about future climate change, risks and impacts. It integrates infor- mation about key drivers of future climate, the relationship between cumulative emissions and temperature change, and projected changes in the climate system in the 21st century and beyond. It assesses future risks and impacts caused by a changing climate and the interaction of climate-related and other hazards. It provides information about long- term changes including sea-level rise and ocean acidification, and the risk of irreversible and abrupt changes. Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Deve- lopment (Topic 3) addresses future pathways for adaptation and mitigation as complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks of climate change and assesses their interaction with sus- tainable development. It describes analytical approaches for effective Preface decision-making and differences in risks of climate change, adaptation and mitigation in terms of timescale, magnitude and persistence. It analyses the characteristics of adaptation and mitigation pathways, and associated challenges, limits and benefits, including for different levels of future warming. can pride itself on. Our thanks go also to all authors of the AR5 and the two Special Reports because without their careful assessment of the huge body of literature on various aspects of climate change and their comments on the draft report, the preparation of the SYR would not have been possible. Adaptation and Mitigation (Topic 4) brings together information from Working Groups II and III on specific adaptation and mitigation opti- ons, including environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods, behaviour and lifestyle choices. It describes common enabling factors and constraints, and policy approaches, finance and technology on which effective response measures depend. It shows opportunities for integrated responses and links adaptation and mitigation with other societal objectives. Throughout the AR5, we benefitted greatly from the wisdom and insight of our colleagues in the IPCC leadership, especially Dr Thomas Stocker and Dr Qin Dahe, Working Group I Co-Chairs; Dr Chris Field and Dr Vicente Barros, Working Group II Co-Chairs; and Dr Ottmar Edenhofer, Dr Ramón Pichs-Madruga and Dr Youba Sokona, Working Group III Co-Chairs. Their cooperation on issues related to knowledge from the reports of all three Working Groups was a definite asset for the production of a high-quality final document. Process The SYR of the AR5 of the IPCC has been prepared in accordance with the procedures of the IPCC to ensure adequate effort and rigor being achieved in the process. For the AR5 the preparation of the SYR was taken in hand a year earlier than was the case with the Fourth Assess- ment Report (AR4) – while the Working Group Reports were still being completed – with a view to enhancing integration and ensuring adequate synthesis. A scoping meeting specifically for proposing the detailed outline of the AR5 Synthesis Report was held in Liège, Belgium in August, 2010, and the outline produced in that meeting was approved by the Panel in October, 2010 in Busan, Republic of Korea. In accordance with IPCC procedures, the IPCC Chair in consultation with the Co-Chairs of the Working Groups nominated authors for the Core Writing Team (CWT) of the SYR and a total of 45 CWT members and 9 Review Editors were selected and accepted by the IPCC Bureau in March, 2012. In addition, 14 Extended Writing Team (EWT) authors were selected by the CWT with the approval of the Chair of the IPCC, and this latter group contributed substantially to the material and the text provided in this report. During evolution of the contents of the SYR the IPCC Bureau was approached and it approved the inclusion of 6 additional CWT members and an additional Review Editor. This further enhanced and deepened the expertise required for the preparation of the Report. The final draft report which has undergone a combined review by experts and governments was submitted to the 40th Session of the IPCC, held from 27 October to 1 November 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark, where governments approved the SPM line by line and adopted the longer report section by section. Acknowledgements Our profound gratitude and deep indebtedness goes to the members of the Core Writing Team and the substantial help from the Extended Writing Team members, for their tireless efforts, expertise, and ama- zing level of dedication throughout the production of the SYR. The SYR could not have been completed successfully without their inspirational commitment to excellence and integrity, and their meticulous attenti- on to detail. We also wish to thank the Review Editors for their inva- luable help ensuring that the SYR provides a balanced and complete assessment of current information relevant to climate change. Their role was crucial to ensure transparency of the process which the IPCC viii We also wish to thank Fredolin Tangang, David Wratt, Eduardo Calvo, Jose Moreno, Jim Skea and Suzana Kahn Ribeiro, who acted as Review Editors during the Approval Session of the SYR, ensuring that the edits made to the SPM during the Session were correctly reflected in the longer report. Their important work guaranteed the high level of trust between the scientists and the governments, enabling them to work smoothly in symbiosis, which is a unique feature of the IPCC and its credibility. We extend our deep appreciation of the enthusiasm, dedication and professional contributions of Gian-Kasper Plattner, Melinda Tignor and Judith Boschung from the Technical Support Unit of Working Group I, Katie Mach and Eren Bilir from the Technical Support Unit of Working Group II, Ellie Farahani, Jussi Savolainen and Steffen Schlömer from the Technical Support Unit of Working Group III, and Gerrit Hansen from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research during the Approval Session of the SYR, working as a team with the Technical Support Unit of the SYR, which was indispensable in the successful outcomes of the Session. A special thanks goes to Adrien Michel from the Technical Support Unit of Working Group I for his work on the SYR figures. Our thanks go to Leo Meyer, Head of the Technical Support Unit of the Synthesis Report, and the members of the Technical Support Unit Sander Brinkman, Line van Kesteren, Noemie Leprince-Ringuet and Fijke van Boxmeer for their capacity to expand their strengths and carry out the mammoth task of coordinating the development and pro- duction of the SYR. Each one of them put in tireless efforts, displaying deep commitment and dedication to ensure the production of an out- standing SYR. We would like to acknowledge the work and innumerable tasks per- formed in support of the preparation, release and publication of the Report by the staff of the IPCC Secretariat: Gaetano Leone, Carlos Martin-Novella, Jonathan Lynn, Brenda Abrar-Milani, Jesbin Baidya, Laura Biagioni, Mary Jean Burer, Annie Courtin, Judith Ewa, Joelle Fernandez, Nina Peeva, Sophie Schlingemann, Amy Smith and Werani Zabula. Thanks are also due to Francis Hayes and Elhousseine Gouaini for acting as conference officers at the approval Session. We are appreciative of the member governments of the IPCC who graciously hosted the SYR scoping meeting, four of our Core Writing Meetings and the 40th Session of the IPCC: Belgium, Norway, The Netherlands, Germany, Malaysia and Denmark. We express our thanks to the governments, WMO, UNEP and the UNFCCC for their contribu- tions to the Trust Fund which supported various elements of expendi- ture. We wish to particularly thank the Governments of Norway and The Netherlands, and the Korea Energy Economics Institute for their generous financial support of the SYR Technical Support Unit, and The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency PBL and The Energy and Resources Institute, New Delhi, for their in-kind support of the SYR Technical Support Unit.

May we convey our deep gratitude to the UNFCCC for their cooperation at various stages of this enterprise and for the prominence they give to our work in several appropriate fora. ix Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers Chapter Summary for Policymakers Introduction This Synthesis Report is based on the reports of the three Working Groups of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including relevant Special Reports. It provides an integrated view of climate change as the ﬁnal part of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). SPM This summary follows the structure of the longer report which addresses the following topics: Observed changes and their causes; Future climate change, risks and impacts; Future pathways for adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development; Adaptation and mitigation. In the Synthesis Report, the certainty in key assessment ﬁndings is communicated as in the Working Group Reports and Special Reports. It is based on the author teams’ evaluations of underlying scientiﬁc understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of conﬁdence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantiﬁed likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain)1. Where appropriate, ﬁndings are also formulated as statements of fact with- out using uncertainty qualiﬁers. This report includes information relevant to Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). SPM 1. Observed Changes and their Causes Human inﬂuence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of green- house gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems. {1} SPM 1.1 Observed changes in the climate system Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. {1.1} Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. The period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years in the Northern Hemisphere, where such assessment is possible (medium conﬁdence). The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C 2 over the period 1880 to 2012, when multiple independently produced datasets exist (Figure SPM.1a). {1.1.1, Figure 1.1} In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, the globally averaged surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability (Figure SPM.1a). Due to this natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reﬂect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate of warming over 1 Each ﬁnding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. In many cases, a synthesis of evidence and agreement supports an assignment of conﬁdence. The summary terms for evidence are: limited, medium or robust. For agreement, they are low, medium or high. A level of conﬁdence is expressed using ﬁve qualiﬁers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium conﬁdence. The follow- ing terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, more unlikely than likely 0–<50%, extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. See for more details: Mastrandrea, M.D., C.B. Field, T.F. Stocker, O. Edenhofer, K.L. Ebi, D.J. Frame, H. Held, E. Kriegler, K.J.

Indicators: (d) Global anthropogenic CO2 emissions from forestry and other land use as well as from burning of fossil fuel, cement production and ﬂaring. Cumulative emissions of CO2 from these sources and their uncertainties are shown as bars and whiskers, respectively, on the right hand side. The global effects of the accumulation of CH4 and N2O emissions are shown in panel c. Greenhouse gas emission data from 1970 to 2010 are shown in Figure SPM.2. {Figures 1.1, 1.3, 1.5} 3 Summary for Policymakers the past 15 years (1998–2012; 0.05 [–0.05 to 0.15] °C per decade), which begins with a strong El Niño, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951 (1951–2012; 0.12 [0.08 to 0.14] °C per decade). {1.1.1, Box 1.1} Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high conﬁdence), with only about 1% stored in the atmosphere. On a global scale, the ocean warming is largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] °C per decade over the period 1971 to 2010. It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0−700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971. {1.1.2, Figure 1.2} Averaged over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, precipitation has increased since 1901 (medium conﬁdence before and high conﬁdence after 1951). For other latitudes, area-averaged long-term positive or negative trends have low conﬁdence. Observations of changes in ocean surface salinity also provide indirect evidence for changes in the global water cycle over the ocean (medium conﬁdence). It is very likely that regions of high salinity, where evaporation dom- inates, have become more saline, while regions of low salinity, where precipitation dominates, have become fresher since the 1950s. {1.1.1, 1.1.2} Since the beginning of the industrial era, oceanic uptake of CO2 has resulted in acidiﬁcation of the ocean; the pH of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1 (high conﬁdence), corresponding to a 26% increase in acidity, measured as hydrogen ion concentration. {1.1.2} Over the period 1992 to 2011, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass (high conﬁdence), likely at a larger rate over 2002 to 2011. Glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide (high conﬁdence). Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has continued to decrease in extent (high conﬁdence). There is high conﬁdence that permafrost tempera- tures have increased in most regions since the early 1980s in response to increased surface temperature and changing snow cover. {1.1.3} The annual mean Arctic sea-ice extent decreased over the period 1979 to 2012, with a rate that was very likely in the range 3.5 to 4.1% per decade. Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased in every season and in every successive decade since 1979, with the most rapid decrease in decadal mean extent in summer (high conﬁdence). It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea-ice extent increased in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade between 1979 and 2012. However, there is high conﬁdence that there are strong regional differences in Antarctica, with extent increasing in some regions and decreasing in others. {1.1.3, Figure 1.1} Over the period 1901 to 2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m (Figure SPM.1b). The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia (high conﬁdence). {1.1.4, Figure 1.1} SPM 1.2 Causes of climate change Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. This has led to atmo- spheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic driv- ers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. {1.2, 1.3.1} Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since the pre-industrial era have driven large increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Figure SPM.1c). Between 1750 and 2011, cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere were 2040 ± 310 GtCO2. About 40% of these emissions have remained in the atmosphere (880 ± 35 GtCO2); the rest was removed from the atmosphere and stored on land (in plants and soils) and in the ocean. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2, causing ocean acidiﬁcation. About half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years (high conﬁdence) (Figure SPM.1d). {1.2.1, 1.2.2} 4 Summary for Policymakers Figure SPM.2 | Total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr) for the period 1970 to 2010 by gases: CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes; CO2 from Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); ﬂuorinated gases covered under the Kyoto Protocol (F-gases). Right hand side shows 2010 emissions, using alternatively CO2-equivalent emission weightings based on IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) and AR5 values. Unless otherwise stated, CO2-equivalent emissions in this report include the basket of Kyoto gases (CO2, CH4, N2O as well as F-gases) calculated based on 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) values from the SAR (see Glos- sary). Using the most recent GWP100 values from the AR5 (right-hand bars) would result in higher total annual GHG emissions (52 GtCO2-eq/yr) from an increased contribution of methane, but does not change the long-term trend signiﬁcantly. {Figure 1.6, Box 3.2} Total anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between 2000 and 2010, despite a growing number of climate change mitigation policies. Anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2010 have reached 49 ± 4.5 GtCO2-eq/yr 3. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% of the total GHG emissions increase from 1970 to 2010, with a similar percentage contribution for the increase during the period 2000 to 2010 (high conﬁdence) (Figure SPM.2). Globally, economic and population growth continued to be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between 2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical to the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth has risen sharply. Increased use of coal has reversed the long-standing trend of gradual decarbonization (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity of energy) of the world’s energy supply (high conﬁdence). {1.2.2} The evidence for human inﬂuence on the climate system has grown since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period (Figure SPM.3). Anthro- pogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century over every continental region except Antarctica4. Anthropogenic inﬂuences have likely affected the global water cycle since 1960 and contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. Anthropogenic inﬂuences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979 and have very likely made a substantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content (0–700 m) and to global mean sea level rise observed since the 1970s. {1.3, Figure 1.10} 3 Greenhouse gas emissions are quantiﬁed as CO2-equivalent (GtCO2-eq) emissions using weightings based on the 100-year Global Warming Potentials, using IPCC Second Assessment Report values unless otherwise stated. {Box 3.2} 4 For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low conﬁdence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming aver- aged over available stations. 5 Figure SPM.3 | Assessed likely ranges (whiskers) and their mid-points (bars) for warming trends over the 1951–2010 period from well-mixed greenhouse gases, other anthropogenic forcings (including the cooling effect of aerosols and the effect of land use change), combined anthropogenic forcings, natural forcings and natural internal climate variability (which is the element of climate variability that arises spontaneously within the climate system even in the absence of forcings). The observed surface temperature change is shown in black, with the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to observational uncertainty. The attributed warming ranges (colours) are based on observations combined with climate model simulations, in order to estimate the contribution of an individual external forcing to the observed warming. The contribution from the combined anthropogenic forcings can be estimated with less uncertainty than the contributions from greenhouse gases and from other anthropogenic forcings separately. This is because these two contributions partially compen- sate, resulting in a combined signal that is better constrained by observations. {Figure 1.9} SPM 1.3 Impacts of climate change In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespec- tive of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate. {1.3.2} Evidence of observed climate change impacts is strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems. In many regions, changing precipitation or melting snow and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms of quantity and quality (medium conﬁdence). Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change (high conﬁdence). Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to climate change, with a major or minor contribution of climate change distinguishable from other inﬂuences (Figure SPM.4). Assessment of many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops shows that negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts (high conﬁdence). Some impacts of ocean acidiﬁcation on marine organisms have been attributed to human inﬂuence (medium conﬁdence). {1.3.2} 6 7SPM 1.4 Extreme eventsChanges in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950. Some of these changes have been linked to human inﬂuences, including a decrease in cold tem-perature extremes, an increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in extreme high sea levels and an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions. {1.4}It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is Figure SPM.4 | Based on the available scientiﬁc literature since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), there are substantially more impacts in recent decades now attributed to climate change. Attribution requires deﬁned scientiﬁc evidence on the role of climate change. Absence from the map of addi-tional impacts attributed to climate change does not imply that such impacts have not occurred. The publications supporting attributed impacts reﬂect a growing knowledge base, but publications are still limited for many regions, systems and processes, highlighting gaps in data and studies. Symbols indicate categories of attributed impacts, the relative contribution of climate change (major or minor) to the observed impact and conﬁdence in attribution. Each symbol refers to one or more entries in WGII Table SPM.A1, grouping related regional-scale impacts. Numbers in ovals indicate regional totals of climate change publications from 2001 to 2010, based on the Scopus bibliographic database for publications in English with individual countries mentioned in title, abstract or key words (as of July 2011). These numbers provide an overall measure of the available scientiﬁc literature on climate change across regions; they do not indicate the number of publications supporting attribution of climate change impacts in each region. Studies for polar regions and small islands are grouped with neighbouring continental regions. The inclusion of publications for assessment of attribution followed IPCC scientiﬁc evidence criteria deﬁned in WGII Chapter 18. Publications considered in the attribution analyses come from a broader range of literature assessed in the WGII AR5. See WGII Table SPM.A1 for descriptions of the attributed impacts. {Figure 1.11} Summary for Policymakers very likely that human inﬂuence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human inﬂuence has more than doubled the prob- ability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. There is medium conﬁdence that the observed warming has increased heat-related human mortality and decreased cold-related human mortality in some regions. {1.4} SPM There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased. Recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharge in some catchments implies greater risks of ﬂooding at regional scale (medium conﬁdence). It is likely that extreme sea levels (for example, as experienced in storm surges) have increased since 1970, being mainly a result of rising mean sea level. {1.4} Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, ﬂoods, cyclones and wildﬁres, reveal signiﬁcant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability (very high conﬁ- dence). {1.4} SPM 2. Future Climate Changes, Risks and Impacts Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks. {2} SPM 2.1 Key drivers of future climate Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Projections of greenhouse gas emissions vary over a wide range, depending on both socio-economic development and climate policy. {2.1} Anthropogenic GHG emissions are mainly driven by population size, economic activity, lifestyle, energy use, land use patterns, technology and climate policy. The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are used for making projections based on these factors, describe four different 21st century pathways of GHG emissions and atmospheric concentrations, air pollutant emissions and land use. The RCPs include a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two intermediate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0) and one scenario with very high GHG emissions (RCP8.5). Scenarios without additional efforts to constrain emissions (’baseline scenarios’) lead to pathways ranging between RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (Figure SPM.5a). RCP2.6 is representative of a scenario that aims to keep global warming likely below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. The RCPs are consistent with the wide range of scenarios in the literature as assessed by WGIII5. {2.1, Box 2.2, 4.3} Multiple lines of evidence indicate a strong, consistent, almost linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and projected global temperature change to the year 2100 in both the RCPs and the wider set of mitigation scenarios analysed in WGIII (Figure SPM.5b). Any given level of warming is associated with a range of cumulative CO2 emissions6, and therefore, e.g., higher emissions in earlier decades imply lower emissions later. {2.2.5, Table 2.2} 5 Roughly 300 baseline scenarios and 900 mitigation scenarios are categorized by CO2-equivalent concentration (CO2-eq) by 2100. The CO2-eq includes the forcing due to all GHGs (including halogenated gases and tropospheric ozone), aerosols and albedo change. 6 Quantiﬁcation of this range of CO2 emissions requires taking into account non-CO2 drivers. 8 9Figure SPM.5 | (a) Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) alone in the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (lines) and the associated scenario categories used in WGIII (coloured areas show 5 to 95% range). The WGIII scenario categories summarize the wide range of emission scenarios published in the scientiﬁc literature and are deﬁned on the basis of CO2-eq concentration levels (in ppm) in 2100. The time series of other greenhouse gas emissions are shown in Box 2.2, Figure 1. (b) Global mean surface temperature increase at the time global CO2 emissions reach a given net cumulative total, plotted as a function of that total, from various lines of evidence. Coloured plume shows the spread of past and future projections from a hierarchy of climate-carbon cycle models driven by historical emissions and the four RCPs over all times out to 2100, and fades with the decreasing number of available models. Ellipses show total anthropogenic warming in 2100 versus cumulative CO2 emissions from 1870 to 2100 from a simple climate model (median climate response) under the scenario categories used in WGIII. The width of the ellipses in terms of temperature is caused by the impact of different scenarios for non-CO2 climate drivers. The ﬁlled black ellipse shows observed emissions to 2005 and observed temperatures in the decade 2000–2009 with associated uncertainties. {Box 2.2, Figure 1; Figure 2.3} Summary for Policymakers Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming to less than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66%7 would require cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources since 1870 to remain below about 2900 GtCO2 (with a range of 2550 to 3150 GtCO2 depending on non-CO2 drivers). About 1900 GtCO2 8 had already been emitted by 2011. For additional context see Table 2.2. {2.2.5} SPM SPM 2.2 Projected changes in the climate system Surface temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century under all assessed emission scenarios. It is very likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer, and that extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent in many regions. The ocean will continue to warm and acidify, and global mean sea level to rise. {2.2} The projected changes in Section SPM 2.2 are for 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005, unless otherwise indicated. Future climate will depend on committed warming caused by past anthropogenic emissions, as well as future anthropogenic emissions and natural climate variability. The global mean surface temperature change for the period 2016–2035 relative to 1986–2005 is similar for the four RCPs and will likely be in the range 0.3°C to 0.7°C (medium conﬁdence). This assumes that there will be no major volcanic eruptions or changes in some natural sources (e.g., CH4 and N2O), or unexpected changes in total solar irradiance. By mid-21st century, the magnitude of the projected climate change is substantially affected by the choice of emissions scenario. {2.2.1, Table 2.1} Relative to 1850–1900, global surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) is projected to likely exceed 1.5°C for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high conﬁdence). Warming is likely to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high conﬁdence), more likely than not to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5 (medium conﬁdence), but unlikely to exceed 2°C for RCP2.6 (medium conﬁdence). {2.2.1} The increase of global mean surface temperature by the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) relative to 1986–2005 is likely to be 0.3°C to 1.7°C under RCP2.6, 1.1°C to 2.6°C under RCP4.5, 1.4°C to 3.1°C under RCP6.0 and 2.6°C to 4.8°C under RCP8.59. The Arctic region will continue to warm more rapidly than the global mean (Figure SPM.6a, Figure SPM.7a). {2.2.1, Figure 2.1, Figure 2.2, Table 2.1} It is virtually certain that there will be more frequent hot and fewer cold temperature extremes over most land areas on daily and seasonal timescales, as global mean surface temperature increases. It is very likely that heat waves will occur with a higher frequency and longer duration. Occasional cold winter extremes will continue to occur. {2.2.1} 7 Corresponding ﬁgures for limiting warming to 2°C with a probability of >50% and >33% are 3000 GtCO2 (range of 2900 to 3200 GtCO2) and 3300 GtCO2 (range of 2950 to 3800 GtCO2) respectively. Higher or lower temperature limits would imply larger or lower cumulative emissions respectively. 8 This corresponds to about two thirds of the 2900 GtCO2 that would limit warming to less than 2°C with a probability of >66%; to about 63% of the total amount of 3000 GtCO2 that would limit warming to less than 2°C with a probability of >50%; and to about 58% of the total amount of 3300 GtCO2 that would limit warming to less than 2°C with a probability of >33%. 9 The period 1986–2005 is approximately 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] °C warmer than 1850–1900. {2.2.1} 10 11Figure SPM.6 | Global average surface temperature change (a) and global mean sea level rise10 (b) from 2006 to 2100 as determined by multi-model simulations. All changes are relative to 1986–2005. Time series of projections and a measure of uncertainty (shading) are shown for scenarios RCP2.6 (blue) and RCP8.5 (red). The mean and associated uncertainties averaged over 2081–2100 are given for all RCP scenarios as coloured vertical bars at the right hand side of each panel. The number of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models used to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated. {2.2, Figure 2.1}Changes in precipitation will not be uniform. The high latitudes and the equatorial Paciﬁc are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation under the RCP8.5 scenario. In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipi-tation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely increase under the RCP8.5 scenario (Figure SPM.7b). Extreme precipitation events over most of the mid-latitude land masses and over wet tropical regions will very likely become more intense and more frequent. {2.2.2, Figure 2.2}The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century, with the strongest warming projected for the surface in tropical and Northern Hemisphere subtropical regions (Figure SPM.7a). {2.2.3, Figure 2.2}10 Based on current understanding (from observations, physical understanding and modelling), only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. There is medium conﬁdence that this additional contribution would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century. Figure SPM.7 | Change in average surface temperature (a) and change in average precipitation (b) based on multi-model mean projections for 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005 under the RCP2.6 (left) and RCP8.5 (right) scenarios. The number of models used to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated in the upper right corner of each panel. Stippling (i.e., dots) shows regions where the projected change is large compared to natural internal variability and where at least 90% of models agree on the sign of change. Hatching (i.e., diagonal lines) shows regions where the projected change is less than one standard deviation of the natural internal variability. {2.2, Figure 2.2} Earth System Models project a global increase in ocean acidiﬁcation for all RCP scenarios by the end of the 21st century, with a slow recovery after mid-century under RCP2.6. The decrease in surface ocean pH is in the range of 0.06 to 0.07 (15 to 17% increase in acidity) for RCP2.6, 0.14 to 0.15 (38 to 41%) for RCP4.5, 0.20 to 0.21 (58 to 62%) for RCP6.0 and 0.30 to 0.32 (100 to 109%) for RCP8.5. {2.2.4, Figure 2.1} Year-round reductions in Arctic sea ice are projected for all RCP scenarios. A nearly ice-free11 Arctic Ocean in the summer sea- ice minimum in September before mid-century is likely for RCP8.512 (medium conﬁdence). {2.2.3, Figure 2.1} It is virtually certain that near-surface permafrost extent at high northern latitudes will be reduced as global mean surface temperature increases, with the area of permafrost near the surface (upper 3.5 m) projected to decrease by 37% (RCP2.6) to 81% (RCP8.5) for the multi-model average (medium conﬁdence). {2.2.3} The global glacier volume, excluding glaciers on the periphery of Antarctica (and excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets), is projected to decrease by 15 to 55% for RCP2.6 and by 35 to 85% for RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). {2.2.3} 11 When sea-ice extent is less than one million km2 for at least ﬁve consecutive years. 12 Based on an assessment of the subset of models that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and 1979–2012 trend of the Arctic sea-ice extent. 12 Summary for Policymakers There has been signiﬁcant improvement in understanding and projection of sea level change since the AR4. Global mean sea level rise will continue during the 21st century, very likely at a faster rate than observed from 1971 to 2010. For the period 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005, the rise will likely be in the ranges of 0.26 to 0.55 m for RCP2.6, and of 0.45 to 0.82 m for RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence)10 (Figure SPM.6b). Sea level rise will not be uniform across regions. By the end of the 21st century, it is very likely that sea level will rise in more than about 95% of the ocean area. About 70% of the coastlines worldwide are projected to experience a sea level change within ±20% of the global mean. {2.2.3} SPM SPM 2.3 Future risks and impacts caused by a changing climate Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human sys- tems. Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development. {2.3} Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of climate-related hazards (including hazardous events and trends) with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, including their ability to adapt. Rising rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidiﬁcation, increase the risk of severe, pervasive and in some cases irreversible detrimental impacts. Some risks are particularly relevant for individual regions (Figure SPM.8), while others are global. The overall risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidiﬁcation. The precise levels of climate change sufﬁcient to trigger abrupt and irreversible change remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds increases with rising temperature (medium conﬁdence). For risk assessment, it is important to evaluate the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. {1.5, 2.3, 2.4, 3.3, Box Introduction.1, Box 2.3, Box 2.4} A large fraction of species faces increased extinction risk due to climate change during and beyond the 21st century, espe- cially as climate change interacts with other stressors (high conﬁdence). Most plant species cannot naturally shift their geographical ranges sufﬁciently fast to keep up with current and high projected rates of climate change in most landscapes; most small mammals and freshwater molluscs will not be able to keep up at the rates projected under RCP4.5 and above in ﬂat landscapes in this century (high conﬁdence). Future risk is indicated to be high by the observation that natural global climate change at rates lower than current anthropogenic climate change caused signiﬁcant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years. Marine organisms will face progressively lower oxygen levels and high rates and magnitudes of ocean acidiﬁcation (high conﬁdence), with associated risks exacerbated by rising ocean temperature extremes (medium conﬁdence). Coral reefs and polar ecosystems are highly vulnerable. Coastal systems and low-lying areas are at risk from sea level rise, which will continue for centuries even if the global mean temperature is stabilized (high conﬁdence). {2.3, 2.4, Figure 2.5} Climate change is projected to undermine food security (Figure SPM.9). Due to projected climate change by the mid-21st century and beyond, global marine species redistribution and marine biodiversity reduction in sensitive regions will challenge the sustained provision of ﬁsheries productivity and other ecosystem services (high conﬁdence). For wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temper- ate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production for local temperature increases of 2°C or more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may beneﬁt (medium conﬁdence). Global tem- perature increases of ~4°C or more13 above late 20th century levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose large risks to food security globally (high conﬁdence). Climate change is projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions (robust evidence, high agreement), intensifying competition for water among sectors (limited evidence, medium agreement). {2.3.1, 2.3.2} 13 Projected warming averaged over land is larger than global average warming for all RCP scenarios for the period 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005. For regional projections, see Figure SPM.7. {2.2} 13 Figure SPM.9 | (a) Projected global redistribution of maximum catch potential of ~1000 exploited marine ﬁsh and invertebrate species. Projections compare the 10-year averages 2001–2010 and 2051–2060 using ocean conditions based on a single climate model under a moderate to high warming scenario, without analysis of potential impacts of overﬁshing or ocean acidiﬁcation. (b) Summary of projected changes in crop yields (mostly wheat, maize, rice and soy), due to climate change over the 21st century. Data for each timeframe sum to 100%, indicating the percentage of projections showing yield increases versus decreases. The ﬁgure includes projections (based on 1090 data points) for different emission scenarios, for tropical and temperate regions and for adaptation and no-adaptation cases combined. Changes in crop yields are relative to late 20th century levels. {Figure 2.6a, Figure 2.7} Until mid-century, projected climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist (very high conﬁdence). Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions and especially in developing countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change (high conﬁdence). By 2100 for RCP8.5, the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is expected to compromise common human activities, including growing food and working outdoors (high conﬁdence). {2.3.2} In urban areas climate change is projected to increase risks for people, assets, economies and ecosystems, including risks from heat stress, storms and extreme precipitation, inland and coastal ﬂooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, water scar- city, sea level rise and storm surges (very high conﬁdence). These risks are ampliﬁed for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living in exposed areas. {2.3.2} 15 Summary for Policymakers Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and agricultural incomes, including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world (high conﬁdence). {2.3.2} SPM Aggregate economic losses accelerate with increasing temperature (limited evidence, high agreement), but global economic impacts from climate change are currently difﬁcult to estimate. From a poverty perspective, climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difﬁcult, further erode food security and prolong existing and create new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger (medium conﬁ- dence). International dimensions such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks of climate change at regional scales. {2.3.2} Climate change is projected to increase displacement of people (medium evidence, high agreement). Populations that lack the resources for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme weather events, particularly in developing coun- tries with low income. Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conﬂicts by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conﬂicts such as poverty and economic shocks (medium conﬁdence). {2.3.2} SPM 2.4 Climate change beyond 2100, irreversibility and abrupt changes Many aspects of climate change and associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. {2.4} Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions. A large frac- tion of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period. {2.4, Figure 2.8} Stabilization of global average surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate system. Shifting biomes, soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long timescales which will result in changes lasting hundreds to thousands of years after global surface temperature is stabilized. {2.1, 2.4} There is high conﬁdence that ocean acidiﬁcation will increase for centuries if CO2 emissions continue, and will strongly affect marine ecosystems. {2.4} It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100, with the amount of rise dependent on future emissions. The threshold for the loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, and an asso- ciated sea level rise of up to 7 m, is greater than about 1°C (low conﬁdence) but less than about 4°C (medium conﬁdence) of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is possible, but current evidence and understanding is insufﬁcient to make a quantitative assessment. {2.4} Magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium- to high-emission scenarios pose an increased risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands (medium conﬁdence). A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain with continued rise in global temperatures. {2.4} 16 Summary for Policymakers SPM 3. Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks of climate change. Substantial emissions reductions over the next few decades can reduce cli- mate risks in the 21st century and beyond, increase prospects for effective adaptation, reduce the costs and challenges of mitigation in the longer term and contribute to climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development. {3.2, 3.3, 3.4} SPM SPM 3.1 Foundations of decision-making about climate change Effective decision-making to limit climate change and its effects can be informed by a wide range of analytical approaches for evaluating expected risks and beneﬁts, recognizing the importance of governance, ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments, economic assess- ments and diverse perceptions and responses to risk and uncertainty. {3.1} Sustainable development and equity provide a basis for assessing climate policies. Limiting the effects of climate change is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity, including poverty eradication. Countries’ past and future contri- butions to the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and countries also face varying challenges and circum- stances and have different capacities to address mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice and fairness. Many of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed and contribute little to GHG emis- sions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens from the present to the future, and insufﬁcient adaptation responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Comprehensive strategies in response to climate change that are consistent with sustainable development take into account the co-beneﬁts, adverse side effects and risks that may arise from both adaptation and mitigation options. {3.1, 3.5, Box 3.4} The design of climate policy is inﬂuenced by how individuals and organizations perceive risks and uncertainties and take them into account. Methods of valuation from economic, social and ethical analysis are available to assist decision-making. These methods can take account of a wide range of possible impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large conse- quences. But they cannot identify a single best balance between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts. {3.1} Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, because most GHGs accumulate over time and mix globally, and emissions by any agent (e.g., individual, community, company, country) affect other agents. Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate change issues. The effectiveness of adaptation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, including international cooperation. The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation. {3.1} SPM 3.2 Climate change risks reduced by mitigation and adaptation Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, wide- spread and irreversible impacts globally (high conﬁdence). Mitigation involves some level of co-beneﬁts and of risks due to adverse side effects, but these risks do not involve the same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change, increasing the beneﬁts from near-term mitigation efforts. {3.2, 3.4} Mitigation and adaptation are complementary approaches for reducing risks of climate change impacts over different time- scales (high conﬁdence). Mitigation, in the near term and through the century, can substantially reduce climate change 17 Summary for Policymakers18SPMimpacts in the latter decades of the 21st century and beyond. Beneﬁts from adaptation can already be realized in addressing current risks, and can be realized in the future for addressing emerging risks. {3.2, 4.5}Five Reasons For Concern (RFCs) aggregate climate change risks and illustrate the implications of warming and of adaptation limits for people, economies and ecosystems across sectors and regions. The ﬁve RFCs are associated with: (1) Unique and threatened systems, (2) Extreme weather events, (3) Distribution of impacts, (4) Global aggregate impacts, and (5) Large-scale singular events. In this report, the RFCs provide information relevant to Article 2 of UNFCCC. {Box 2.4}Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally (high conﬁdence) (Figure SPM.10). In most scenarios without additional mitigation efforts (those with 2100 atmospheric concentrations Figure SPM.10 | The relationship between risks from climate change, temperature change, cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and changes in annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Limiting risks across Reasons For Concern (a) would imply a limit for cumulative emissions of CO2 (b) which would constrain annual GHG emissions over the next few decades (c). Panel a reproduces the ﬁve Reasons For Concern {Box 2.4}. Panel b links temperature changes to cumulative CO2 emissions (in GtCO2) from 1870. They are based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations (pink plume) and on a simple climate model (median climate response in 2100), for the baselines and ﬁve mitigation scenario categories (six ellipses). Details are provided in Figure SPM.5. Panel c shows the relationship between the cumulative CO2 emissions (in GtCO2) of the scenario catego-ries and their associated change in annual GHG emissions by 2050, expressed in percentage change (in percent GtCO2-eq per year) relative to 2010. The ellipses correspond to the same scenario categories as in Panel b, and are built with a similar method (see details in Figure SPM.5). {Figure 3.1} Summary for Policymakers >1000 ppm CO2-eq), warming is more likely than not to exceed 4°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 (Table SPM.1). The risks associated with temperatures at or above 4°C include substantial species extinction, global and regional food insecurity, consequential constraints on common human activities and limited potential for adaptation in some cases (high conﬁdence). Some risks of climate change, such as risks to unique and threatened systems and risks associated with extreme weather events, are moderate to high at temperatures 1°C to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. {2.3, Figure 2.5, 3.2, 3.4, Box 2.4, Table SPM.1} Substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades can substantially reduce risks of climate change by limiting warming in the second half of the 21st century and beyond. Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Limiting risks across RFCs would imply a limit for cumulative emissions of CO2. Such a limit would require that global net emissions of CO2 eventually decrease to zero and would constrain annual emissions over the next few decades (Figure SPM.10) (high conﬁdence). But some risks from climate damages are unavoid- able, even with mitigation and adaptation. {2.2.5, 3.2, 3.4} SPM Mitigation involves some level of co-beneﬁts and risks, but these risks do not involve the same possibility of severe, wide- spread and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change. Inertia in the economic and climate system and the possibility of irreversible impacts from climate change increase the beneﬁts from near-term mitigation efforts (high conﬁdence). Delays in additional mitigation or constraints on technological options increase the longer-term mitigation costs to hold climate change risks at a given level (Table SPM.2). {3.2, 3.4} SPM 3.3 Characteristics of adaptation pathways Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but there are limits to its effec- tiveness, especially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer- term perspective, in the context of sustainable development, increases the likelihood that more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. {3.3} Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of populations, the security of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-speciﬁc (high conﬁdence). A ﬁrst step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability (high conﬁdence). Integration of adaptation into planning, including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with develop- ment and disaster risk reduction. Building adaptive capacity is crucial for effective selection and implementation of adapta- tion options (robust evidence, high agreement). {3.3} Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments (high conﬁdence). National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national govern- ments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversiﬁcation and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and ﬁnancial support (robust evidence, high agreement). Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of commu- nities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and ﬁnancing (medium evidence, high agreement). {3.3} Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal values, objectives and risk perceptions (high conﬁdence). Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can beneﬁt decision-making processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge with existing practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation. {3.3} Constraints can interact to impede adaptation planning and implementation (high conﬁdence). Common constraints on implementation arise from the following: limited ﬁnancial and human resources; limited integration or coordination of gov- ernance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence of key adapta- tion leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Another constraint includes insufﬁcient research, monitoring, and observation and the ﬁnance to maintain them. {3.3} 19 Summary for Policymakers Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits (high conﬁdence). Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints. Further, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term outcomes or failing to sufﬁciently anticipate conse- quences can result in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future or the vulner- ability of other people, places or sectors (medium evidence, high agreement). Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes. {3.3} Signiﬁcant co-beneﬁts, synergies and trade-offs exist between mitigation and adaptation and among different adap- tation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions (very high conﬁdence). Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections among water, energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of actions with co-beneﬁts include (i) improved energy efﬁciency and cleaner energy sources, leading to reduced emissions of health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants; (ii) reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; (iii) sustainable agriculture and forestry; and (iv) protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services. {3.3} Transformations in economic, social, technological and political decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote sustainable development (high conﬁdence). At the national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reﬂects a country’s own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities. Restricting adaptation responses to incremental changes to existing systems and structures, without consider- ing transformational change, may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities. Planning and implementation of trans- formational adaptation could reﬂect strengthened, altered or aligned paradigms and may place new and increased demands on governance structures to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address possible equity and ethical implications. Adaptation pathways are enhanced by iterative learning, deliberative processes and innovation. {3.3} SPM 3.4 Characteristics of mitigation pathways There are multiple mitigation pathways that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. These pathways would require substantial emissions reductions over the next few decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by the end of the century. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological, eco- nomic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional mitigation and if key technologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales. {3.4} Without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global emissions growth is expected to persist, driven by growth in global population and economic activities. Global mean surface temperature increases in 2100 in baseline scenarios—those without additional mitigation—range from 3.7°C to 4.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response. They range from 2.5°C to 7.8°C when including climate uncertainty (5th to 95th percentile range) (high conﬁdence). {3.4}14 Emissions scenarios leading to CO2-equivalent concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels15. These scenarios are characterized by 40 to 70% global anthropogenic GHG emissions reductions by 2050 compared to 201016, and emissions levels near zero or below in 2100. Mitigation scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more likely than not to limit temperature change to less than 2°C, unless they temporarily overshoot concentration levels of roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq 15 For comparison, the CO2-eq concentration in 2011 is estimated to be 430 ppm (uncertainty range 340 to 520 ppm) 16 This range differs from the range provided for a similar concentration category in the AR4 (50 to 85% lower than 2000 for CO2 only). Reasons for this difference include that this report has assessed a substantially larger number of scenarios than in the AR4 and looks at all GHGs. In addition, a large proportion of the new scenarios include Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies (see below). Other factors include the use of 2100 concentration levels instead of stabilization levels and the shift in reference year from 2000 to 2010. SPM 20 Summary for Policymakers before 2100, in which case they are about as likely as not to achieve that goal. In these 500 ppm CO2-eq scenarios, global 2050 emissions levels are 25 to 55% lower than in 2010. Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are characterized by a greater reliance on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies beyond mid-century (and vice versa). Trajectories that are likely to limit warming to 3°C relative to pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming to 2°C. A lim- ited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are characterized by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission reduction between 70% and 95% below 2010. For a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and their likelihood to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Figure SPM.11 and Table SPM.1. {3.4} SPM Figure SPM.11 | Global greenhouse gas emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr) in baseline and mitigation scenarios for different long-term concentration levels (a) and associated upscaling requirements of low-carbon energy (% of primary energy) for 2030, 2050 and 2100 compared to 2010 levels in mitigation scenarios (b). {Figure 3.2} 21 Notes: a The ‘total range’ for the 430 to 480 ppm CO2-eq concentrations scenarios corresponds to the range of the 10th to 90th percentile of the subcategory of these scenarios shown in Table 6.3 of the Working Group III Report. b Baseline scenarios fall into the >1000 and 720 to 1000 ppm CO2-eq categories. The latter category also includes mitigation scenarios. The baseline sce- narios in the latter category reach a temperature change of 2.5°C to 5.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 in 2100. Together with the baseline scenarios in the >1000 ppm CO2-eq category, this leads to an overall 2100 temperature range of 2.5°C to 7.8°C (range based on median climate response: 3.7°C to 4.8°C) for baseline scenarios across both concentration categories. c The global 2010 emissions are 31% above the 1990 emissions (consistent with the historic greenhouse gas emission estimates presented in this report). CO2-eq emissions include the basket of Kyoto gases (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) as well as ﬂuorinated gases). d The assessment here involves a large number of scenarios published in the scientiﬁc literature and is thus not limited to the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). To evaluate the CO2-eq concentration and climate implications of these scenarios, the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) was used in a probabilistic mode. For a comparison between MAGICC model results and the outcomes of the models used in WGI, see WGI 12.4.1.2, 12.4.8 and WGIII 6.3.2.6. e The assessment in this table is based on the probabilities calculated for the full ensemble of scenarios in WGIII AR5 using MAGICC and the assessment in WGI of the uncertainty of the temperature projections not covered by climate models. The statements are therefore consistent with the statements in WGI, which are based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) runs of the RCPs and the assessed uncertainties. Hence, the likelihood statements reﬂect different lines of evidence from both WGs. This WGI method was also applied for scenarios with intermediate concentration levels where no CMIP5 runs are available. The likelihood statements are indicative only {WGIII 6.3} and follow broadly the terms used by the WGI SPM for temperature projections: likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, and unlikely 0–33%. In addition the term more unlikely than likely 0–<50% is used. f The CO2-equivalent concentration (see Glossary) is calculated on the basis of the total forcing from a simple carbon cycle/climate model, MAGICC. The CO2- equivalent concentration in 2011 is estimated to be 430 ppm (uncertainty range 340 to 520 ppm). This is based on the assessment of total anthropogenic radiative forcing for 2011 relative to 1750 in WGI, i.e., 2.3 W/m2, uncertainty range 1.1 to 3.3 W/m2. g The vast majority of scenarios in this category overshoot the category boundary of 480 ppm CO2-eq concentration. h For scenarios in this category, no CMIP5 run or MAGICC realization stays below the respective temperature level. Still, an unlikely assignment is given to reﬂect uncertainties that may not be reﬂected by the current climate models. i Scenarios in the 580 to 650 ppm CO2-eq category include both overshoot scenarios and scenarios that do not exceed the concentration level at the high end of the category (e.g., RCP4.5). The latter type of scenarios, in general, have an assessed probability of more unlikely than likely to stay below the 2°C temperature level, while the former are mostly assessed to have an unlikely probability of staying below this level. j In these scenarios, global CO2-eq emissions in 2050 are between 70 to 95% below 2010 emissions, and they are between 110 to 120% below 2010 emissions in 2100. 22 Figure SPM.12 | The implications of different 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels for the rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions and low-carbon energy upscaling in mitigation scenarios that are at least about as likely as not to keep warming throughout the 21st century below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels (2100 CO2-equivalent concentrations of 430 to 530 ppm). The scenarios are grouped according to different emissions levels by 2030 (coloured in different shades of green). The left panel shows the pathways of GHG emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/ yr) leading to these 2030 levels. The black dot with whiskers gives historic GHG emission levels and associated uncertainties in 2010 as reported in Figure SPM.2. The black bar shows the estimated uncertainty range of GHG emissions implied by the Cancún Pledges. The middle panel denotes the average annual CO2 emissions reduction rates for the period 2030–2050. It compares the median and interquartile range across scenarios from recent inter-model comparisons with explicit 2030 interim goals to the range of scenarios in the Scenario Database for WGIII AR5. Annual rates of historical emissions change (sustained over a period of 20 years) and the average annual CO2 emission change between 2000 and 2010 are shown as well. The arrows in the right panel show the magnitude of zero and low-carbon energy supply upscaling from 2030 to 2050 subject to different 2030 GHG emissions levels. Zero- and low-carbon energy supply includes renewables, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) or bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). [Note: Only scenarios that apply the full, unconstrained mitigation technology portfolio of the underlying models (default technology assumption) are shown. Scenarios with large net negative global emissions (>20 GtCO2-eq/yr), scenarios with exogenous carbon price assumptions and scenarios with 2010 emissions signiﬁcantly outside the historical range are excluded.] {Figure 3.3} Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 (consistent with a likely chance to keep warming below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels) typically involve temporary overshoot17 of atmospheric concentrations, as do many scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 (Table SPM.1). Depending on the level of overshoot, overshoot scenarios typically rely on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation in the second half of the century. The availability and scale of these and other CDR technologies and methods are uncertain and CDR technologies are, to varying degrees, associated with challenges and risks18. CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios without overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is more expensive (high conﬁdence). {3.4, Box 3.3} Reducing emissions of non-CO2 agents can be an important element of mitigation strategies. All current GHG emissions and other forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude of climate change over the next few decades, although long-term warming is mainly driven by CO2 emissions. Emissions of non-CO2 forcers are often expressed as ‘CO2-equivalent emissions’, but the choice of metric to calculate these emissions, and the implications for the emphasis and timing of abatement of the various climate forcers, depends on application and policy context and contains value judgments. {3.4, Box 3.2} 17 In concentration ‘overshoot’ scenarios, concentrations peak during the century and then decline. 18 CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on the global scale. There is insufﬁcient knowledge to quantify how much CO2 emissions could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. CDR methods may carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale. 23 Figure SPM.13 | Global mitigation costs in cost-effective scenarios at different atmospheric concentrations levels in 2100. Cost-effective scenarios assume immediate mitigation in all countries and a single global carbon price, and impose no additional limitations on technology relative to the models’ default technology assumptions. Consumption losses are shown relative to a baseline development without climate policy (left panel). The table at the top shows percentage points of annualized consumption growth reductions relative to consumption growth in the baseline of 1.6 to 3% per year (e.g., if the reduction is 0.06 percentage points per year due to mitigation, and baseline growth is 2.0% per year, then the growth rate with mitigation would be 1.94% per year). Cost estimates shown in this table do not consider the beneﬁts of reduced climate change or co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects of mitigation. Estimates at the high end of these cost ranges are from models that are relatively inﬂexible to achieve the deep emissions reductions required in the long run to meet these goals and/or include assumptions about market imperfections that would raise costs. {Figure 3.4} Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. It will require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions from 2030 to 2050; a much more rapid scale-up of low-carbon energy over this period; a larger reliance on CDR in the long term; and higher transitional and long-term economic impacts. Estimated global emissions levels in 2020 based on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective mitigation trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, but they do not preclude the option to meet this goal (high conﬁdence) (Figure SPM.12, Table SPM.2). {3.4} Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions, but increase with the stringency of mitigation. Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately, in which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all key technologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for estimating macro-economic mitigation costs (Figure SPM.13). Under these assumptions mitigation scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption—not including beneﬁts of reduced climate change as well as co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects of mitiga- tion—of 1 to 4% (median: 1.7%) in 2030, 2 to 6% (median: 3.4%) in 2050 and 3 to 11% (median: 4.8%) in 2100 relative to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than 900% over the century (Figure SPM.13). These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 (median: 0.06) percentage points over the century relative to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6 and 3% per year (high conﬁdence). {3.4} In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies (such as bioenergy, CCS and their combination BECCS, nuclear, wind/solar), mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered. Delaying additional mitigation increases mitigation costs in the medium to long term. Many models could not limit likely warming to below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels if additional mitigation is considerably delayed. Many models could not limit likely warming to below 2°C if bioenergy, CCS and their combination (BECCS) are limited (high conﬁdence) (Table SPM.2). {3.4} 24 Table SPM.2 | Increase in global mitigation costs due to either limited availability of speciﬁc technologies or delays in additional mitigation a relative to cost-effective scenarios b. The increase in costs is given for the median estimate and the 16th to 84th percentile range of the scenarios (in parentheses) c. In addition, the sample size of each scenario set is provided in the coloured symbols. The colours of the symbols indicate the fraction of models from systematic model comparison exercises that could successfully reach the targeted concentration level. {Table 3.2} Summary for Policymakers Notes: a Delayed mitigation scenarios are associated with greenhouse gas emission of more than 55 GtCO2-eq in 2030, and the increase in mitigation costs is mea- sured relative to cost-effective mitigation scenarios for the same long-term concentration level. b Cost-effective scenarios assume immediate mitigation in all countries and a single global carbon price, and impose no additional limitations on technology relative to the models’ default technology assumptions. c The range is determined by the central scenarios encompassing the 16th to 84th percentile range of the scenario set. Only scenarios with a time horizon until 2100 are included. Some models that are included in the cost ranges for concentration levels above 530 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 could not produce associ- ated scenarios for concentration levels below 530 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 with assumptions about limited availability of technologies and/or delayed additional mitigation. d No CCS: carbon dioxide capture and storage is not included in these scenarios. Nuclear phase out: no addition of nuclear power plants beyond those under construction, and operation of existing plants until the end of their lifetime. Limited Solar/Wind: a maximum of 20% global electricity generation from solar and wind power in any year of these scenarios. Limited Bioenergy: a maximum of 100 EJ/yr modern bioenergy supply globally (modern bioenergy used for heat, power, combinations and industry was around 18 EJ/yr in 2008). EJ = Exajoule = 1018 Joule. e Percentage increase of net present value of consumption losses in percent of baseline consumption (for scenarios from general equilibrium models) and abatement costs in percent of baseline gross domestic product (GDP, for scenarios from partial equilibrium models) for the period 2015–2100, discounted at 5% per year. Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy security objectives, with signiﬁcant co-beneﬁts for human health, ecosystem impacts and sufﬁciency of resources and resilience of the energy system. {4.4.2.2} Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters, but differences between regions and fuels exist (high conﬁdence). Most mitigation scenarios are associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major exporters (high conﬁdence). The availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effects of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel assets (medium conﬁdence). {4.4.2.2} Solar Radiation Management (SRM) involves large-scale methods that seek to reduce the amount of absorbed solar energy in the climate system. SRM is untested and is not included in any of the mitigation scenarios. If it were deployed, SRM would 25 Summary for Policymakers entail numerous uncertainties, side effects, risks and shortcomings and has particular governance and ethical implications. SRM would not reduce ocean acidiﬁcation. If it were terminated, there is high conﬁdence that surface temperatures would rise very rapidly impacting ecosystems susceptible to rapid rates of change. {Box 3.3} SPM SPM 4. Adaptation and Mitigation Many adaptation and mitigation options can help address climate change, but no single option is sufﬁcient by itself. Effective implementation depends on policies and cooperation at all scales and can be enhanced through integrated responses that link adaptation and mitiga- tion with other societal objectives. {4} SPM 4.1 Common enabling factors and constraints for adaptation and mitigation responses Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned by common enabling factors. These include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods and behavioural and lifestyle choices. {4.1} Inertia in many aspects of the socio-economic system constrains adaptation and mitigation options (medium evidence, high agreement). Innovation and investments in environmentally sound infrastructure and technologies can reduce GHG emis- sions and enhance resilience to climate change (very high conﬁdence). {4.1} Vulnerability to climate change, GHG emissions and the capacity for adaptation and mitigation are strongly inﬂuenced by livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture (medium evidence, medium agreement). Also, the social acceptability and/or effectiveness of climate policies are inﬂuenced by the extent to which they incentivize or depend on regionally appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours. {4.1} For many regions and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation essential for managing climate change risks (high conﬁdence). Improving institutions as well as coordination and cooperation in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction (very high conﬁdence). {4.1} SPM 4.2 Response options for adaptation Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation and potential to reduce climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions. Some adaptation responses involve signiﬁcant co-beneﬁts, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will increase challenges for many adaptation options. {4.2} Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the public and private sectors and within communities. There is increasing recognition of the value of social (including local and indigenous), institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints to adaptation. Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning processes, with more limited implementation of responses (high conﬁdence). {1.6, 4.2, 4.4.2.1} The need for adaptation along with associated challenges is expected to increase with climate change (very high conﬁdence). Adaptation options exist in all sectors and regions, with diverse potential and approaches depending on their context in vulnerability reduction, disaster risk management or proactive adaptation planning (Table SPM.3). Effective strategies and actions consider the potential for co-beneﬁts and opportunities within wider strategic goals and development plans. {4.2} 26 Table SPM.3 | Approaches for managing the risks of climate change through adaptation. These approaches should be considered overlapping rather than discrete, and they are often pursued simultaneously. Examples are presented in no speciﬁc order and can be relevant to more than one category. {Table 4.2} Summary for Policymakers SPM 27 Summary for Policymakers SPM 4.3 Response options for mitigation Mitigation options are available in every major sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the green- house gas intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors. {4.3} SPM Well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions than a focus on individual technologies and sectors, with efforts in one sector affecting the need for mitigation in others (medium conﬁ- dence). Mitigation measures intersect with other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-beneﬁts or adverse side effects. These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking climate action. {4.3} Emissions ranges for baseline scenarios and mitigation scenarios that limit CO2-equivalent concentrations to low levels (about 450 ppm CO2-eq, likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) are shown for different sectors and gases in Figure SPM.14. Key measures to achieve such mitigation goals include decarbonizing (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity of) electricity generation (medium evidence, high agreement) as well as efﬁciency enhancements and behavioural changes, in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising development (robust evidence, high agreement). In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below 2010 levels between 2040 and 2070. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios (about 450 to about 500 ppm CO2-eq, at least about as likely as not to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels), the share of low-carbon electricity supply (comprising renewable energy (RE), nuclear and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) including bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS)) increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by 2100. {4.3} Figure SPM.14 | Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by sector and total non-CO2 greenhouse gases (Kyoto gases) across sectors in baseline (faded bars) and mitigation scenarios (solid colour bars) that reach about 450 (430 to 480) ppm CO2-eq concentrations in 2100 (likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre- industrial levels). Mitigation in the end-use sectors leads also to indirect emissions reductions in the upstream energy supply sector. Direct emissions of the end-use sectors thus do not include the emission reduction potential at the supply-side due to, for example, reduced electricity demand. The numbers at the bottom of the graphs refer to the number of scenarios included in the range (upper row: baseline scenarios; lower row: mitigation scenarios), which differs across sectors and time due to different sectoral resolution and time horizon of models. Emissions ranges for mitigation scenarios include the full portfolio of mitigation options; many models cannot reach 450 ppm CO2-eq concentration by 2100 in the absence of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). Negative emissions in the electricity sector are due to the application of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS). ‘Net’ agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions consider afforestation, reforestation as well as deforestation activities. {4.3, Figure 4.1} 28 Summary for Policymakers Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more ﬂexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures, and are associated with important co-beneﬁts. The most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing deforestation, with large differences in their relative importance across regions; and in agriculture, cropland management, grazing land management and restoration of organic soils (medium evidence, high agreement). {4.3, Figures 4.1, 4.2, Table 4.3} Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable inﬂuence on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change (medium evidence, medium agreement). Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns, adoption of energy savings measures, dietary change and reduction in food wastes. {4.1, 4.3} SPM SPM 4.4 Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and ﬁnance Effective adaptation and mitigation responses will depend on policies and measures across multiple scales: international, regional, national and sub-national. Policies across all scales supporting technology development, diffusion and transfer, as well as ﬁnance for responses to climate change, can complement and enhance the effectiveness of policies that directly promote adaptation and mitigation. {4.4} International cooperation is critical for effective mitigation, even though mitigation can also have local co-beneﬁts. Adapta- tion focuses primarily on local to national scale outcomes, but its effectiveness can be enhanced through coordination across governance scales, including international cooperation: {3.1, 4.4.1} • The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the main multilateral forum focused on addressing climate change, with nearly universal participation. Other institutions organized at different levels of gover- nance have resulted in diversifying international climate change cooperation. {4.4.1} • The Kyoto Protocol offers lessons towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with respect to participation, implementation, ﬂexibility mechanisms and environmental effectiveness (medium evidence, low agree- ment). {4.4.1} • Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national climate policies offer potential climate change mitigation ben- eﬁts (medium evidence, medium agreement). Potential advantages include lower mitigation costs, decreased emission leakage and increased market liquidity. {4.4.1} • International cooperation for supporting adaptation planning and implementation has received less attention histori- cally than mitigation but is increasing and has assisted in the creation of adaptation strategies, plans and actions at the national, sub-national and local level (high conﬁdence). {4.4.1} There has been a considerable increase in national and sub-national plans and strategies on both adaptation and mitigation since the AR4, with an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-beneﬁts and reduce adverse side effects (high conﬁdence): {4.4.2.1, 4.4.2.2} • National governments play key roles in adaptation planning and implementation (robust evidence, high agreement) through coordinating actions and providing frameworks and support. While local government and the private sector have different functions, which vary regionally, they are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and ﬁnancing (medium evidence, high agreement). {4.4.2.1} • Institutional dimensions of adaptation governance, including the integration of adaptation into planning and decision- making, play a key role in promoting the transition from planning to implementation of adaptation (robust evidence, 29 Summary for Policymakers high agreement). Examples of institutional approaches to adaptation involving multiple actors include economic options (e.g., insurance, public-private partnerships), laws and regulations (e.g., land-zoning laws) and national and government policies and programmes (e.g., economic diversiﬁcation). {4.2, 4.4.2.1, Table SPM.3} SPM • In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitiga- tion in a cost-effective way but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining (limited evidence, medium agreement). In some countries, tax-based policies speciﬁcally aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and GDP (high conﬁdence). In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes (although not necessarily designed for the purpose of mitigation) have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes. {4.4.2.2} • Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often environmentally effective (medium evi- dence, medium agreement). Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efﬁciency standards; examples of infor- mation programmes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions. {4.4.2.2} • Sector-speciﬁc mitigation policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies (medium evidence, high agreement). Sector-speciﬁc policies may be better suited to address sector-speciﬁc barriers or market failures and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies. Although theoretically more cost-effective, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to implement. Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions. {4.4.2.2} • Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increasing number and variety of renewable energy (RE) policies including subsidies—motivated by many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years. At the same time, reducing subsidies for GHG-related activities in various sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic context (high conﬁdence). {4.4.2.2} Co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development. The potential for co-beneﬁts for energy end-use measures outweighs the potential for adverse side effects whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) measures. Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper the ability of socie- ties to expand access to modern energy services to underserved populations (low conﬁdence). These potential adverse side effects on energy access can be avoided with the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other beneﬁt transfer mechanisms (medium conﬁdence). Whether or not side effects materialize, and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-speciﬁc, and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementa- tion. Many co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects have not been well-quantiﬁed. {4.3, 4.4.2.2, Box 3.4} Technology policy (development, diffusion and transfer) complements other mitigation policies across all scales, from interna- tional to sub-national; many adaptation efforts also critically rely on diffusion and transfer of technologies and management practices (high conﬁdence). Policies exist to address market failures in R&D, but the effective use of technologies can also depend on capacities to adopt technologies appropriate to local circumstances. {4.4.3} Substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes in investment patterns (high conﬁdence). For mitigation scenarios that stabilize concentrations (without overshoot) in the range of 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 210019, annual invest- ments in low carbon electricity supply and energy efﬁciency in key sectors (transport, industry and buildings) are projected in the scenarios to rise by several hundred billion dollars per year before 2030. Within appropriate enabling environments, the private sector, along with the public sector, can play important roles in ﬁnancing mitigation and adaptation (medium evidence, high agreement). {4.4.4} 19 This range comprises scenarios that reach 430 to 480 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 (likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) and scenarios that reach 480 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 (without overshoot: more likely than not to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels). 30 Summary for Policymakers Financial resources for adaptation have become available more slowly than for mitigation in both developed and developing countries. Limited evidence indicates that there is a gap between global adaptation needs and the funds available for adapta- tion (medium conﬁdence). There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation costs, funding and investment. Potential synergies between international ﬁnance for disaster risk management and adaptation have not yet been fully realized (high conﬁdence). {4.4.4} SPM 4.5 Trade-offs, synergies and interactions with sustainable development SPM Climate change is a threat to sustainable development. Nonetheless, there are many opportu- nities to link mitigation, adaptation and the pursuit of other societal objectives through inte- grated responses (high conﬁdence). Successful implementation relies on relevant tools, suit- able governance structures and enhanced capacity to respond (medium conﬁdence). {3.5, 4.5} Climate change exacerbates other threats to social and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor (high conﬁdence). Aligning climate policy with sustainable development requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation (high conﬁdence). Delaying global mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways and adaptation in the future. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increas- ing complexity of interactions, encompassing connections among human health, water, energy, land use and biodiversity (medium evidence, high agreement). {3.1, 3.5, 4.5} Strategies and actions can be pursued now which will move towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development, while at the same time helping to improve livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental manage- ment. In some cases, economic diversiﬁcation can be an important element of such strategies. The effectiveness of integrated responses can be enhanced by relevant tools, suitable governance structures and adequate institutional and human capacity (medium conﬁdence). Integrated responses are especially relevant to energy planning and implementation; interactions among water, food, energy and biological carbon sequestration; and urban planning, which provides substantial opportu- nities for enhanced resilience, reduced emissions and more sustainable development (medium conﬁdence). {3.5, 4.4, 4.5} 31 n o i t c u d o r t n I Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report 1 Introduction n o i t c u d o r t n I 35 Introduction Introduction n o i t c u d o r t n I The Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) provides an overview of the state of knowledge concerning the science of climate change, emphasizing new results since the publication of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in 2007. The SYR synthe- sizes the main ﬁndings of the AR5 based on contributions from Work- ing Group I (The Physical Science Basis), Working Group II (Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability) and Working Group III (Mitigation of Climate Change), plus two additional IPCC reports (Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation and Spe- cial Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation). The AR5 SYR longer report is divided into four topics. Topic 1 (Observed Changes and their Causes) focuses on observational evidence for a changing climate, the impacts caused by this change and the human contributions to it. Topic 2 (Future Climate Changes, Risks and Impacts) assesses projections of future climate change and the resultant pro- jected impacts and risks. Topic 3 (Future Pathways for Adaptation, Miti- gation and Sustainable Development) considers adaptation and miti- gation as complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks of climate change. Topic 4 (Adaptation and Mitigation) describes individual adaptation and mitigation options and policy approaches. It also addresses integrated responses that link mitigation and adapta- tion with other societal objectives. The challenges of understanding and managing risks and uncertainties are important themes in this report. See Box 1 (Risk and the Manage- ment of an Uncertain Future) and Box 2 (Communicating the Degree of Certainty in Assessment Findings). This report includes information relevant to Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Box Introduction.1 | Risk and the Management of an Uncertain Future Climate change exposes people, societies, economic sectors and ecosystems to risk. Risk is the potential for consequences when some- thing of value is at stake and the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values. {WGII SPM Background Box SPM.2, WGIII 2.1, SYR Glossary} Risks from climate change impacts arise from the interaction between hazard (triggered by an event or trend related to climate change), vulnerability (susceptibility to harm) and exposure (people, assets or ecosystems at risk). Hazards include processes that range from brief events, such as severe storms, to slow trends, such as multi-decade droughts or multi-century sea level rise. Vulnerability and exposure are both sensitive to a wide range of social and economic processes, with possible increases or decreases depending on development pathways. Risks and co-beneﬁts also arise from policies that aim to mitigate climate change or to adapt to it. (1.5) Risk is often represented as the probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the magnitude of the conse- quences if these events occur. Therefore, high risk can result not only from high probability outcomes but also from low probability out- comes with very severe consequences. This makes it important to assess the full range of possible outcomes, from low probability tail outcomes to very likely outcomes. For example, it is unlikely that global mean sea level will rise by more than one meter in this century, but the consequence of a greater rise could be so severe that this possibility becomes a signiﬁcant part of risk assessment. Similarly, low conﬁdence but high consequence outcomes are also policy relevant; for instance the possibility that the response of Amazon forest could substantially amplify climate change merits consideration despite our currently imperfect ability to project the outcome. (2.4, Table 2.3) {WGI Table 13.5, WGII SPM A-3, 4.4, Box 4-3, WGIII Box 3-9, SYR Glossary} Risk can be understood either qualitatively or quantitatively. It can be reduced and managed using a wide range of formal or informal tools and approaches that are often iterative. Useful approaches for managing risk do not necessarily require that risk levels can be accurately quantiﬁed. Approaches recognizing diverse qualitative values, goals and priorities, based on ethical, psychological, cultural or social factors, could increase the effectiveness of risk management. {WGII 1.1.2, 2.4, 2.5, 19.3, WGIII 2.4, 2.5, 3.4} 36 Introduction Box Introduction.2 | Communicating the Degree of Certainty in Assessment Findings An integral feature of IPCC reports is the communication of the strength of and uncertainties in scientific understanding underlying assessment findings. Uncertainty can result from a wide range of sources. Uncertainties in the past and present are the result of limita- tions of available measurements, especially for rare events, and the challenges of evaluating causation in complex or multi-component processes that can span physical, biological and human systems. For the future, climate change involves changing likelihoods of diverse outcomes. Many processes and mechanisms are well understood, but others are not. Complex interactions among multiple climatic and non-climatic influences changing over time lead to persistent uncertainties, which in turn lead to the possibility of surprises. Compared to past IPCC reports, the AR5 assesses a substantially larger knowledge base of scientific, technical and socio-economic literature. {WGI 1.4, WGII SPM A-3, 1.1.2, WGIII 2.3} I n t r o d u c t i o n The IPCC Guidance Note on Uncertainty a defines a common approach to evaluating and communicating the degree of certainty in findings of the assessment process. Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. In many cases, a synthesis of evidence and agreement supports an assignment of confidence, especially for findings with stronger agreement and mul- tiple independent lines of evidence. The degree of certainty in each key finding of the assessment is based on the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement. The summary terms for evidence are: limited, medium or robust. For agreement, they are low, medium or high. Levels of confidence include five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and are typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. The likelihood, or probability, of some well-defined outcome having occurred or occurring in the future can be described quantitatively through the follo- wing terms: virtually certain, 99–100% probability; extremely likely, 95–100%; very likely, 90–100%; likely, 66–100%; more likely than not, >50–100%; about as likely as not, 33–66%; unlikely, 0–33%; very unlikely, 0–10%; extremely unlikely, 0–5%; and exceptionally unlikely, 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely, 95–100%; more likely than not, >50–100%; more unlikely than likely, 0–<50%; and extremely unlikely, 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. Unless otherwise indicated, findings assigned a likelihood term are associated with high or very high confidence. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. {WGI SPM B, WGII Background Box SPM.3, WGIII 2.1} a Mastrandrea, M.D., C.B. Field, T.F.

Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems. Topic 1 focuses on observational evidence of a changing climate, the impacts caused by this change and the human contributions to it. It discusses observed changes in climate (1.1) and external inﬂuences on climate (forcings), differentiating those forcings that are of anthropogenic origin, and their contributions by economic sectors and greenhouse gases (GHGs) (1.2). Section 1.3 attributes observed climate change to its causes and attributes impacts on human and natural systems to climate change, determining the degree to which those impacts can be attributed to climate change. The changing probability of extreme events and their causes are discussed in Section 1.4, followed by an account of exposure and vulnerability within a risk context (1.5) and a section on adaptation and mitigation experience (1.6). 1 1.1 Observed changes in the climate system Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmo- sphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. 1.1.1 Atmosphere Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. The period from 1983 to 2012 was very likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years in the Northern Hemisphere, where such assess- ment is possible (high conﬁdence) and likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years (medium conﬁdence). {WGI 2.4.3, 5.3.5} The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C20 over the period 1880 to 2012, for which multiple inde- pendently produced datasets exist. The total increase between the average of the 1850–1900 period and the 2003–2012 period is 0.78 [0.72 to 0.85] °C, based on the single longest dataset available. For the longest period when calculation of regional trends is sufﬁciently com- plete (1901 to 2012), almost the entire globe has experienced surface warming (Figure 1.1). {WGI SPM B.1, 2.4.3} In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, the globally averaged surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual vari- ability (Figure 1.1). Due to this natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reﬂect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate of warming over the past 15 years (1998–2012; 0.05 [–0.05 to 0.15] °C per decade), which begins with a strong El Niño, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951 (1951–2012; 0.12 [0.08 to 0.14] °C per decade; see Box 1.1). {WGI SPM B.1, 2.4.3} Based on multiple independent analyses of measurements, it is virtu- ally certain that globally the troposphere has warmed and the lower stratosphere has cooled since the mid-20th century. There is medium conﬁdence in the rate of change and its vertical structure in the North- ern Hemisphere extratropical troposphere. {WGI SPM B.1, 2.4.4} Conﬁdence in precipitation change averaged over global land areas since 1901 is low prior to 1951 and medium afterwards. Averaged over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, precipitation has likely increased since 1901 (medium conﬁdence before and high conﬁdence after 1951). For other latitudes area-averaged long-term positive or negative trends have low conﬁdence (Figure 1.1). {WGI SPM B.1, Figure SPM.2, 2.5.1} 1.1.2 Ocean Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high conﬁdence) with only about 1% stored in the atmosphere (Figure 1.2). On a global scale, the ocean warming is largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] °C per decade over the period 1971 to 2010. It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0−700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971. It is likely that the ocean warmed from 700 to 2000 m from 1957 to 2009 and from 3000 m to the bottom for the period 1992 to 2005 (Figure 1.2). {WGI SPM B.2, 3.2, Box 3.1} It is very likely that regions of high surface salinity, where evaporation dominates, have become more saline, while regions of low salinity, where precipitation dominates, have become fresher since the 1950s. These regional trends in ocean salinity provide indirect evidence for changes in evaporation and precipitation over the oceans and thus for changes in the global water cycle (medium conﬁdence). There is no observational evidence of a long-term trend in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). {WGI SPM B.2, 2.5, 3.3, 3.4.3, 3.5, 3.6.3} 20 Ranges in square brackets indicate a 90% uncertainty interval unless otherwise stated. The 90% uncertainty interval is expected to have a 90% likelihood of covering the value that is being estimated. Uncertainty intervals are not necessarily symmetric about the corresponding best estimate. A best estimate of that value is also given where available. 40 Observed Changes and their Causes Observed Changes and their Causes Topic 1 Topic 1 Figure 1.1 | Multiple observed indicators of a changing global climate system.

Grid boxes where the trend is signiﬁcant, at the 10% level, are indicated by a + sign. {WGI Figure SPM.1, Figure 2.21, Figure TS.2; a list- ing of data sets and further technical details are given in the WGI Technical Summary Supplementary Material WGI TS.SM.1.2} (c) Arctic (July to September average) and Antarctic (February) sea ice extent. {WGI Figure SPM.3, Figure 4.3, Figure 4.SM.2; a listing of data sets and further technical details are given in the WGI Technical Summary Supplementary Material WGI TS.SM.3.2}.

(e) Map of observed precipitation change, from 1951 to 2010; trends in annual accumulation calculated using the same criteria as in Panel b. {WGI Figure SPM.2, TS TFE.1, Figure 2, Figure 2.29. A listing of data sets and further technical details are given in the WGI Technical Summary Supplementary Material WGI TS.SM.2.1} Since the beginning of the industrial era, oceanic uptake of CO2 has resulted in acidiﬁcation of the ocean; the pH of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1 (high conﬁdence), corresponding to a 26% increase in acidity, measured as hydrogen ion concentration. There is medium conﬁdence that, in parallel to warming, oxygen concen- trations have decreased in coastal waters and in the open ocean thermocline in many ocean regions since the 1960s, with a likely expansion of tropical oxygen minimum zones in recent decades. {WGI SPM B.5, TS2.8.5, 3.8.1, 3.8.2, 3.8.3, 3.8.5, Figure 3.20} 41 Topic 1 Observed Changes and their Causes The annual mean Arctic sea ice extent decreased over the period 1979 (when satellite observations commenced) to 2012. The rate of decrease was very likely in the range 3.5 to 4.1% per decade. Arctic sea ice extent has decreased in every season and in every successive decade since 1979, with the most rapid decrease in decadal mean extent in summer (high conﬁdence). For the summer sea ice minimum, the decrease was very likely in the range of 9.4 to 13.6% per decade (range of 0.73 to 1.07 million km2 per decade) (see Figure 1.1). It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea ice extent increased in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade (range of 0.13 to 0.20 million km2 per decade) between 1979 and 2012. However, there is high conﬁdence that there are strong regional differences in Antarctica, with extent increasing in some regions and decreasing in others. {WGI SPM B.5, 4.2.2, 4.2.3} There is very high conﬁdence that the extent of Northern Hemisphere snow cover has decreased since the mid-20th century by 1.6 [0.8 to 2.4] % per decade for March and April, and 11.7% per decade for June, over the 1967 to 2012 period. There is high conﬁdence that permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions of the Northern Hemi- sphere since the early 1980s, with reductions in thickness and areal extent in some regions. The increase in permafrost temperatures has occurred in response to increased surface temperature and changing snow cover. {WGI SPM B.3, 4.5, 4.7.2} 1.1.4 Sea level Over the period 1901–2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m (Figure 1.1). The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia (high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM B.4, 3.7.2, 5.6.3, 13.2} It is very likely that the mean rate of global averaged sea level rise was 1.7 [1.5 to 1.9] mm/yr between 1901 and 2010 and 3.2 [2.8 to 3.6] mm/yr between 1993 and 2010. Tide gauge and satellite altimeter data are consistent regarding the higher rate during the latter period. It is likely that similarly high rates occurred between 1920 and 1950. {WGI SPM B.4, 3.7, 13.2} Since the early 1970s, glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion from warming together explain about 75% of the observed global mean sea level rise (high conﬁdence). Over the period 1993–2010, global mean sea level rise is, with high conﬁdence, consistent with the sum of the observed contributions from ocean thermal expansion, due to warming, from changes in glaciers, the Greenland ice sheet, the Antarctic ice sheet and land water storage. {WGI SPM B.4, 13.3.6} Rates of sea level rise over broad regions can be several times larger or smaller than the global mean sea level rise for periods of several decades, due to ﬂuctuations in ocean circulation. Since 1993, the regional rates for the Western Paciﬁc are up to three times larger than the global mean, while those for much of the Eastern Paciﬁc are near zero or negative. {WGI 3.7.3, FAQ 13.1} There is very high conﬁdence that maximum global mean sea level during the last interglacial period (129,000 to 116,000 years ago) was, for several thousand years, at least 5 m higher than present and Figure 1.2 | Energy accumulation within the Earth’s climate system. Estimates are in 1021 J, and are given relative to 1971 and from 1971 to 2010, unless otherwise indicated. Components included are upper ocean (above 700 m), deep ocean (below 700 m; including below 2000 m estimates starting from 1992), ice melt (for glaciers and ice caps, Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet estimates starting from 1992, and Arctic sea ice estimate from 1979 to 2008), continental (land) warming, and atmospheric warming (estimate starting from 1979). Uncertainty is estimated as error from all ﬁve components at 90% conﬁdence intervals. {WGI Box 3.1, Figure 1} 1.1.3 Cryosphere Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass (high conﬁdence). Glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide (high conﬁdence). North- ern Hemisphere spring snow cover has continued to decrease in extent (high conﬁdence). There is high conﬁdence that there are strong regional differences in the trend in Antarctic sea ice extent, with a very likely increase in total extent. {WGI SPM B.3, 4.2–4.7} Glaciers have lost mass and contributed to sea level rise throughout the 20th century. The rate of ice mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet has very likely substantially increased over the period 1992 to 2011, resulting in a larger mass loss over 2002 to 2011 than over 1992 to 2011. The rate of ice mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, mainly from the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica, is also likely larger over 2002 to 2011. {WGI SPM B.3, SPM B.4, 4.3.3, 4.4.2, 4.4.3} 42 Observed Changes and their Causes Topic 1 n o i t c u d o r t n I 1 Box 1.1 | Recent Temperature Trends and their Implications The observed reduction in surface warming trend over the period 1998 to 2012 as compared to the period 1951 to 2012, is due in roughly equal measure to a reduced trend in radiative forcing and a cooling contribution from natural internal variability, which includes a possible redistribution of heat within the ocean (medium conﬁdence). The rate of warming of the observed global mean surface temperature over the period from 1998 to 2012 is estimated to be around one-third to one-half of the trend over the period from 1951 to 2012 (Box 1.1, Figures 1a and 1c). Even with this reduction in surface warming trend, the climate system has very likely continued to accumulate heat since 1998 (Figure 1.2) and sea level has continued to rise (Figure 1.1). {WGI SPM D.1, Box 9.2} The radiative forcing of the climate system has continued to increase during the 2000s, as has its largest contributor, the atmospheric concentration of CO2. However, the radiative forcing has been increasing at a lower rate over the period from 1998 to 2011, compared to 1984 to 1998 or 1951 to 2011, due to cooling effects from volcanic eruptions and the cooling phase of the solar cycle over the period from 2000 to 2009. There is, however, low conﬁdence in quantifying the role of the forcing trend in causing the reduction in the rate of surface warming. {WGI 8.5.2, Box 9.2} For the period from 1998 to 2012, 111 of the 114 available climate-model simulations show a surface warming trend larger than the observations (Box 1.1, Figure 1a). There is medium conﬁdence that this difference between models and observations is to a substantial degree caused by natural internal climate variability, which sometimes enhances and sometimes counteracts the long-term externally forced warming trend (compare Box 1.1, Figures 1a and 1b; during the period from 1984 to 1998, most model simulations show a smaller warming trend than observed). Natural internal variability thus diminishes the relevance of short trends for long-term climate change. The difference between models and observations may also contain contributions from inadequacies in the solar, volcanic and aerosol forcings used by the models and, in some models, from an overestimate of the response to increasing greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcing (the latter dominated by the effects of aerosols). {WGI 2.4.3, Box 9.2, 9.4.1, 10.3.1.1} For the longer period from 1951 to 2012, simulated surface warming trends are consistent with the observed trend (very high conﬁdence) (Box 1.1, Figure 1c). Furthermore, the independent estimates of radiative forcing, of surface warming and of observed heat storage (the latter available since 1970) combine to give a heat budget for the Earth that is consistent with the assessed likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity20 (1.5–4.5 ºC)21. The record of observed climate change has thus allowed characterization of the basic properties of the climate system that have implications for future warming, including the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response (see Topic 2). {WGI Box 9.2, 10.8.1, 10.8.2, Box 12.2, Box 13.1} Box 1.1, Figure 1 | Trends in the global mean surface temperature over the periods from 1998 to 2012 (a), 1984 to 1998 (b), and 1951 to 2012 (c), from observations (red) and the 114 available simulations with current-generation climate models (grey bars). The height of each grey bar indicates how often a trend of a certain magnitude (in °C per decade) occurs among the 114 simulations. The width of the red-hatched area indicates the statistical uncertainty that arises from constructing a global average from individual station data. This observational uncertainty differs from the one quoted in the text of Section 1.1.1; there, an estimate of natural internal variability is also included. Here, by contrast, the magnitude of natural internal variability is characterised by the spread of the model ensemble. {based on WGI Box 9.2, Figure 1} 21 The connection between the heat budget and equilibrium climate sensitivity, which is the long-term surface warming under an assumed doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, arises because a warmer surface causes enhanced radiation to space which counteracts the increase in the Earth’s heat content. How much the radiation to space increases for a given increase in surface temperature depends on the same feedback processes (e.g., cloud feedback, water vapour feedback) that determine equilibrium climate sensitivity. 43 Topic 1 Observed Changes and their Causes high conﬁdence that it did not exceed 10 m above present. During the last interglacial period, the Greenland ice sheet very likely contributed between 1.4 and 4.3 m to the higher global mean sea level, implying with medium conﬁdence an additional contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet. This change in sea level occurred in the context of different orbital forcing and with high-latitude surface temperature, averaged over several thousand years, at least 2°C warmer than present (high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM B.4, 5.3.4, 5.6.2, 13.2.1} 1.2 Past and recent drivers of climate change 1 Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era driven largely by economic and population growth. From 2000 to 2010 emissions were the highest in history. Historical emissions have driven atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide to levels that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years, leading to an uptake of energy by the climate system. Natural and anthropogenic substances and processes that alter the Earth’s energy budget are physical drivers of climate change. Radiative forcing quantiﬁes the perturbation of energy into the Earth system caused by these drivers. Radiative forcings larger than zero lead to a near-surface warming, and radiative forcings smaller than zero lead to a cooling. Radiative forcing is estimated based on in-situ and remote observations, properties of GHGs and aerosols, and calculations using numerical models. The radiative forcing over the 1750–2011 period is shown in Figure 1.4 in major groupings. The ‘Other Anthropogenic’ group is principally comprised of cooling effects from aerosol changes, with smaller contributions from ozone changes, land use reﬂectance changes and other minor terms. {WGI SPM C, 8.1, 8.5.1} 1.2.1 Natural and anthropogenic radiative forcings Atmospheric concentrations of GHGs are at levels that are unprecedented in at least 800,000 years. Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) have all shown large increases since 1750 (40%, 150% and 20%, respectively) (Figure 1.3). CO2 concentrations are increasing at the fastest observed decadal rate of change (2.0 ± 0.1 ppm/yr) for 2002– 2011. After almost one decade of stable CH4 concentrations since the late 1990s, atmospheric measurements have shown renewed increases since 2007. N2O concentrations have steadily increased at a rate of 0.73 ± 0.03 ppb/yr over the last three decades. {WGI SPM B5, 2.2.1, 6.1.2, 6.1.3, 6.3} The total anthropogenic radiative forcing over 1750–2011 is calculated to be a warming effect of 2.3 [1.1 to 3.3] W/m2 (Figure 1.4), and it has increased more rapidly since 1970 than during prior decades. Carbon dioxide is the largest single con- tributor to radiative forcing over 1750–2011 and its trend since 1970. The total anthropogenic radiative forcing estimate for 2011 is substantially higher (43%) than the estimate reported in the IPCC 44 Figure 1.3 | Observed changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2, green), methane (CH4, orange), and nitrous oxide (N2O, red). Data from ice cores (symbols) and direct atmospheric measure- ments (lines) are overlaid. {WGI 2.2, 6.2, 6.3, Figure 6.11} Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for the year 2005. This is caused by a combination of continued growth in most GHG concentrations and an improved estimate of radiative forcing from aerosols. {WGI SPM C, 8.5.1} The radiative forcing from aerosols, which includes cloud adjustments, is better understood and indicates a weaker cooling effect than in AR4. The aerosol radiative forcing over 1750–2011 is estimated as –0.9 [–1.9 to −0.1] W/m2 (medium conﬁdence). Radiative forcing from aerosols has two competing components: a dominant cooling effect from most aerosols and their cloud adjustments and a partially offsetting warming con- tribution from black carbon absorption of solar radiation. There is high conﬁdence that the global mean total aerosol radiative forcing has counteracted a substantial portion of radiative forcing from well- mixed GHGs. Aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty to the total radiative forcing estimate. {WGI SPM C, 7.5, 8.3, 8.5.1} Changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols cause natu- ral radiative forcing (Figure 1.4). The radiative forcing from strato- spheric volcanic aerosols can have a large cooling effect on the climate system for some years after major volcanic eruptions. Changes in total solar irradiance are calculated to have contributed only around 2% of the total radiative forcing in 2011, relative to 1750. {WGI SPM C, Figure SPM.5, 8.4} Observed Changes and their Causes Topic 1 2040 ± 310 GtCO2 were added to the atmosphere between 1750 and 2011. Since 1970, cumulative CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and ﬂaring have tripled, and cumula- tive CO2 emissions from forestry and other land use21(FOLU)22 have increased by about 40% (Figure 1.5)23. In 2011, annual CO2 emis- sions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and ﬂaring were 34.8 ± 2.9 GtCO2/yr. For 2002–2011, average annual emissions from FOLU were 3.3 ± 2.9 GtCO2/yr. {WGI 6.3.1, 6.3.2, WGIII SPM.3} About 40% of these anthropogenic CO2 emissions have remained in the atmosphere (880 ± 35 GtCO2) since 1750. The rest was removed from the atmosphere by sinks, and stored in natural carbon cycle reservoirs. Sinks from ocean uptake and vege- tation with soils account, in roughly equal measures, for the remainder of the cumulative CO2 emissions. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2, causing ocean acidiﬁcation. {WGI 3.8.1, 6.3.1} n o i t c u d o r t n I 1 Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between 2000 and 2010 (high conﬁdence). Despite a growing number of climate change mitigation policies, annual GHG emissions grew on average by 1.0 GtCO2-eq (2.2%) per year, from 2000 to 2010, com- pared to 0.4 GtCO2-eq (1.3%) per year, from 1970 to 2000 (Figure 1.6)24. Total anthropogenic GHG emissions from 2000 to 2010 were the highest in human history and reached 49 (±4.5) GtCO2-eq/yr in 2010. The global economic crisis of 2007/2008 reduced emissions only tem- porarily. {WGIII SPM.3, 1.3, 5.2, 13.3, 15.2.2, Box TS.5, Figure 15.1} Figure 1.4 | Radiative forcing of climate change during the industrial era (1750–2011). Bars show radiative forcing from well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHG), other anthropogenic forcings, total anthropogenic forcings and natural forcings. The error bars indicate the 5 to 95% uncertainty. Other anthropogenic forc- ings include aerosol, land use surface reﬂectance and ozone changes. Natural forcings include solar and volcanic effects. The total anthropogenic radiative forcing for 2011 relative to 1750 is 2.3 W/m2 (uncertainty range 1.1 to 3.3 W/m2). This corresponds to a CO2-equivalent concentration (see Glossary) of 430 ppm (uncertainty range 340 to 520 ppm). {Data from WGI 7.5 and Table 8.6} 1.2.2 Human activities affecting emission drivers About half of the cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years (high conﬁdence). Cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions of Figure 1.5 | Annual global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2/yr) from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and ﬂaring, and forestry and other land use (FOLU), 1750–2011. Cumulative emissions and their uncertainties are shown as bars and whiskers, respectively, on the right-hand side. The global effects of the accumulation of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are shown in Figure 1.3. Greenhouse gas emission data from 1970 to 2010 are shown in Figure 1.6. {modiﬁed from WGI Figure TS.4 and WGIII Figure TS.2} 22 Forestry and other land use (FOLU)—also referred to as LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry)—is the subset of agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions and removals of GHGs related to direct human-induced LULUCF activities, excluding agricultural emissions and removals (see WGIII AR5 Glossary). 23 Numbers from WGI 6.3 converted into GtCO2 units. Small differences in cumulative emissions from Working Group III {WGIII SPM.3, TS.2.1} are due to different approaches to rounding, different end years and the use of different data sets for emissions from FOLU. Estimates remain extremely close, given their uncertainties. 24 CO2-equivalent emission is a common scale for comparing emissions of different GHGs. Throughout the SYR, when historical emissions of GHGs are provided in GtCO2-eq, they are weighted by Global Warming Potentials with a 100-year time horizon (GWP100), taken from the IPCC Second Assessment Report unless otherwise stated. A unit abbreviation of GtCO2-eq is used. {Box 3.2, Glossary} 45 Figure 1.6 | Total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr) for the period 1970 to 2010, by gases: CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes; CO2 from Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); ﬂuorinated gases covered under the Kyoto Protocol (F-gases). Right hand side shows 2010 emissions, using alternatively CO2-equivalent emission weightings based on IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) and AR5 values. Unless otherwise stated, CO2-equivalent emissions in this report include the basket of Kyoto gases (CO2, CH4, N2O as well as F-gases) calculated based on 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) values from the SAR (see Glossary). Using the most recent GWP100 values from the AR5 (right-hand bars) would result in higher total annual GHG emissions (52 GtCO2-eq/yr) from an increased contribution of methane, but does not change the long-term trend signiﬁcantly. Other metric choices would change the contributions of different gases (see Box 3.2). The 2010 values are shown again broken down into their components with the associated uncertainties (90% conﬁdence interval) indicated by the error bars. Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion are known with an 8% uncertainty margin (90% conﬁdence interval). There are very large uncertainties (of the order of ±50%) attached to the CO2 emissions from FOLU. Uncertainty about the global emissions of CH4, N2O and the F-gases has been estimated at 20%, 60% and 20%, respectively. 2010 was the most recent year for which emission statistics on all gases as well as assessments of uncertainties were essentially complete at the time of data cut off for this report. The uncertainty estimates only account for uncertainty in emissions, not in the GWPs (as given in WGI 8.7). {WGIII Figure SPM.1} CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial pro- cesses contributed about 78% to the total GHG emission increase between 1970 and 2010, with a contribution of sim- ilar percentage over the 2000–2010 period (high conﬁdence). Fossil-fuel-related CO2 emissions reached 32 (±2.7) GtCO2/yr, in 2010, and grew further by about 3% between 2010 and 2011, and by about 1 to 2% between 2011 and 2012. CO2 remains the major anthropo- genic GHG, accounting for 76% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2010. Of the total, 16% comes from CH4, 6.2% from N2O, and 2.0% from ﬂuorinated gases (F-gases) (Figure 1.6)25. Annually, since 1970, about 25% of anthropogenic GHG emissions have been in the form of non-CO2 gases26. {WGIII SPM.3, 1.2, 5.2} Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased by about 10 GtCO2-eq between 2000 and 2010. This increase directly came from the energy (47%), industry (30%), transport (11%) and building (3%) sectors (medium conﬁdence). Accounting for indirect emissions raises the contributions by the building and industry sectors (high conﬁdence). Since 2000, GHG emissions have been growing in all sectors, except in agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU)22. In 2010, 35% of GHG emissions were released by the energy sector, 24% (net emissions) from AFOLU, 21% by industry, 14% by transport and 6.4% by the building sector. When emissions from electricity and heat production are attributed to the sectors that use the ﬁnal energy (i.e., indirect emissions), the shares of the industry and building sectors in global GHG emissions are increased to 31% and 19%, respectively (Figure 1.7). {WGIII SPM.3, 7.3, 8.1, 9.2, 10.3, 11.2} See also Box 3.2 for contributions from various sectors, based on metrics other than 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100). Globally, economic and population growth continue to be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between 2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical to that of the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth has risen sharply (high conﬁdence). Between 2000 and 25 Using the most recent 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) values from the AR5 {WGI 8.7} instead of GWP100 values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report, global GHG emission totals would be slightly higher (52 GtCO2-eq/yr) and non-CO2 emission shares would be 20% for CH4, 5% for N2O and 2.2% for F-gases. 26 For this report, data on non-CO2 GHGs, including F-gases, were taken from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) database {WGIII Annex II.9}, which covers substances included in the Kyoto Protocol in its ﬁrst commitment period. 46 47IntroductionObserved Changes and their Causes Topic 112010, both drivers outpaced emission reductions from improvements in energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) (Figure 1.8). Increased use of coal relative to other energy sources has reversed the long-standing trend in gradual decarbonization (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity of energy) of the world’s energy supply. {WGIII SPM.3, TS.2.2, 1.3, 5.3, 7.2, 7.3, 14.3}1.3 Attribution of climate changes and impacts The evidence for human inﬂuence on the climate system has grown since AR4. Human inﬂuence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reduc-tions in snow and ice, and in global mean sea level rise; and it is extremely likely to have been the domi-nant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate.The causes of observed changes in the climate system, as well as in any natural or human system impacted by climate, are established follow-ing a consistent set of methods. Detection addresses the question of whether climate or a natural or human system affected by climate has actually changed in a statistical sense, while attribution evaluates the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to an observed change Figure 1.7 | Total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr) from economic sectors in 2010. The circle shows the shares of direct GHG emissions (in % of total anthropogenic GHG emissions) from ﬁve economic sectors in 2010. The pull-out shows how shares of indirect CO2 emissions (in % of total anthropogenic GHG emissions) from electricity and heat production are attributed to sectors of ﬁnal energy use. ‘Other energy’ refers to all GHG emission sources in the energy sector as deﬁned in WGIII Annex II, other than electricity and heat production {WGIII Annex II.9.1}. The emission data on agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) includes land-based CO2 emissions from forest ﬁres, peat ﬁres and peat decay that approximate to net CO2 ﬂux from the sub-sectors of forestry and other land use (FOLU) as described in Chapter 11 of the WGIII report. Emissions are converted into CO2-equivalents based on 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100), taken from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). Sector deﬁnitions are provided in WGIII Annex II.9. {WGIII Figure SPM.2}Figure 1.8 | Decomposition of the change in total annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion by decade and four driving factors: population, income (gross domestic product, GDP) per capita, energy intensity of GDP and carbon intensity of energy.

The change in emissions over each decade is measured in gigatonnes of CO2 per year (GtCO2/yr); income is converted into common units, using purchasing power parities. {WGIII SPM.3} Topic 1 Observed Changes and their Causes or event with an assignment of statistical conﬁdence27. Attribution of climate change to causes quantiﬁes the links between observed climate change and human activity, as well as other, natural, climate drivers. In contrast, attribution of observed impacts to climate change considers the links between observed changes in natural or human systems and observed climate change, regardless of its cause. Results from studies attributing climate change to causes provide estimates of the magni- tude of warming in response to changes in radiative forcing and hence support projections of future climate change (Topic 2). Results from studies attributing impacts to climate change provide strong indica- tions for the sensitivity of natural or human systems to future climate change. {WGI 10.8, WGII SPM A-1, WGI/II/III/SYR Glossaries} 1.3.1 1 Attribution of climate changes to human and natural inﬂuences on the climate system It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concen- trations and other anthropogenic forcings together (Figure 1.9). The best estimate of the human induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period. GHGs contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be in the range of 0.5°C to 1.3°C over the period 1951 to 2010, with further contributions from other anthropogenic forcings, including the cooling effect of aerosols, from natural forcings, and from natural internal variability (see Figure 1.9). Figure 1.9 | Assessed likely ranges (whiskers) and their mid-points (bars) for warming trends over the 1951–2010 period from well-mixed greenhouse gases, other anthro- pogenic forcings (including the cooling effect of aerosols and the effect of land use change), combined anthropogenic forcings, natural forcings, and natural internal cli- mate variability (which is the element of climate variability that arises spontaneously within the climate system, even in the absence of forcings). The observed surface tem- perature change is shown in black, with the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to obser- vational uncertainty. The attributed warming ranges (colours) are based on observations combined with climate model simulations, in order to estimate the contribution by an individual external forcing to the observed warming. The contribution from the com- bined anthropogenic forcings can be estimated with less uncertainty than the separate contributions from greenhouse gases and other anthropogenic forcings separately. This is because these two contributions partially compensate, resulting in a signal that is better constrained by observations. {Based on Figure WGI TS.10} Together these assessed contributions are consistent with the observed warming of approximately 0.6°C to 0.7°C over this period. {WGI SPM D.3, 10.3.1} It is very likely that anthropogenic inﬂuence, particularly GHGs and stratospheric ozone depletion, has led to a detectable observed pat- tern of tropospheric warming and a corresponding cooling in the lower stratosphere since 1961. {WGI SPM D.3, 2.4.4, 9.4.1, 10.3.1} Over every continental region except Antarctica, anthropogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century (Figure 1.10). For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low conﬁ- dence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations. In contrast, it is likely that there has been an anthropogenic contribution to the very substantial Arctic warming since the mid-20th century. Human inﬂuence has likely contributed to temperature increases in many sub-continental regions. {WGI SPM D.3, TS.4.8, 10.3.1} Anthropogenic inﬂuences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea ice loss since 1979 (Figure 1.10). There is low conﬁdence in the scientiﬁc understanding of the small observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent due to the incomplete and competing scientiﬁc explanations for the causes of change and low conﬁdence in estimates of natural internal variability in that region. {WGI SPM D.3, 10.5.1, Figure 10.16} Anthropogenic inﬂuences likely contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Green- land ice sheet since 1993. Due to a low level of scientiﬁc understand- ing, however, there is low conﬁdence in attributing the causes of the observed loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet over the past two decades. It is likely that there has been an anthropogenic contribu- tion to observed reductions in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover since 1970. {WGI 4.3.3, 10.5.2, 10.5.3} It is likely that anthropogenic inﬂuences have affected the global water cycle since 1960. Anthropogenic inﬂuences have contributed to observed increases in atmospheric moisture content (medium conﬁdence), to global-scale changes in precipitation patterns over land (medium conﬁdence), to intensiﬁcation of heavy precipita- tion over land regions where data are sufﬁcient (medium conﬁdence) (see 1.4) and to changes in surface and subsurface ocean salinity (very likely). {WGI SPM D.3, 2.5.1, 2.6.2, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 7.6.2, 10.3.2, 10.4.2, 10.6} It is very likely that anthropogenic forcings have made a sub- stantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content (0–700 m) observed since the 1970s (Figure 1.10). There is evidence for human inﬂuence in some individual ocean basins. It is very likely that there is a substantial anthropogenic contribution to the global mean sea level rise since the 1970s. This is based on the high conﬁdence in an anthropogenic inﬂuence on the two largest contribu- tions to sea level rise: thermal expansion and glacier mass loss.

Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate. Evidence of observed climate change impacts is strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems. Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to climate change, with a major or minor contribution of climate change distin- guishable from other inﬂuences (Figure 1.11). Impacts on human sys- tems are often geographically heterogeneous because they depend not only on changes in climate variables but also on social and economic factors. Hence, the changes are more easily observed at local levels, while attribution can remain difﬁcult. {WGII SPM A-1, SPM A-3, 18.1, 18.3–18.6} 49 Observed Changes and their Causes Topic 1 Figure 1.11 | Widespread impacts in a changing world: (a) Based on the available scientiﬁc literature since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), there are substantially more impacts in recent decades now attributed to climate change. Attribution requires deﬁned scientiﬁc evidence on the role of climate change. Absence from the map of additional impacts attributed to climate change does not imply that such impacts have not occurred. The publications supporting attributed impacts reﬂect a growing knowledge base, but publications are still limited for many regions, systems and processes, highlighting gaps in data and studies. Symbols indicate categories of attributed impacts, the relative contri- bution of climate change (major or minor) to the observed impact and conﬁdence in attribution. Each symbol refers to one or more entries in WGII Table SPM.A1, grouping related regional-scale impacts. Numbers in ovals indicate regional totals of climate change publications from 2001 to 2010, based on the Scopus bibliographic database for publications in English with individual countries mentioned in title, abstract or key words (as of July 2011). These numbers provide an overall measure of the available scientiﬁc literature on climate change across regions; they do not indicate the number of publications supporting attribution of climate change impacts in each region. Studies for polar regions and small islands are grouped with neighbouring continental regions. The inclusion of publications for assessment of attribution followed IPCC scientiﬁc evidence criteria deﬁned in WGII Chapter 18. Publications considered in the attribution analyses come from a broader range of literature assessed in the WGII AR5. See WGII Table SPM.A1 for descriptions of the attributed impacts.

Glaciers continue to shrink almost worldwide due to climate change (high con- ﬁdence), affecting runoff and water resources downstream (medium conﬁdence). Climate change is causing permafrost warming and thaw- ing in high-latitude regions and in high-elevation regions (high conﬁ- dence). {WGII SPM A-1} Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species interactions in response to ongoing cli- mate change (high conﬁdence). While only a few recent species extinctions have been attributed as yet to climate change (high con- ﬁdence), natural global climate change at rates slower than current anthropogenic climate change caused signiﬁcant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years (high conﬁdence). Increased tree mortality, observed in many places worldwide, has been attributed to climate change in some regions. Increases in the fre- quency or intensity of ecosystem disturbances such as droughts, wind- storms, ﬁres and pest outbreaks have been detected in many parts of the world and in some cases are attributed to climate change (medium conﬁdence). Numerous observations over the last decades in all ocean basins show changes in abundance, distribution shifts poleward and/ or to deeper, cooler waters for marine ﬁshes, invertebrates and phyto- plankton (very high conﬁdence), and altered ecosystem composition (high conﬁdence), tracking climate trends. Some warm-water corals and their reefs have responded to warming with species replacement, bleaching, and decreased coral cover causing habitat loss (high conﬁ- dence). Some impacts of ocean acidiﬁcation on marine organisms have been attributed to human inﬂuence, from the thinning of pteropod and foraminiferan shells (medium conﬁdence) to the declining growth rates of corals (low conﬁdence). Oxygen minimum zones are progressively expanding in the tropical Paciﬁc, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, due to reduced ventilation and O2 solubility in warmer, more stratiﬁed oceans, and are constraining ﬁsh habitat (medium conﬁdence). {WGII SPM A-1, Table SPM.A1, TS A-1, 6.3.2.5, 6.3.3, 18.3–18.4, 30.5.1.1, Box CC-OA, Box CC-CR} Assessment of many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops shows that negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts (high conﬁdence). The smaller number of studies showing positive impacts relate mainly to high-latitude regions, though it is not yet clear whether the balance of impacts has been negative or positive in these regions (high conﬁdence). Climate change has negatively affected wheat and maize yields for many regions and in the global aggregate (medium conﬁdence). Effects on rice and soybean yield have been smaller in major production regions and globally, with a median change of zero across all available data which are fewer for soy compared to the other crops (see Figure 1.11c). Observed impacts relate mainly to production aspects of food security rather than access or other components of food security. Since AR4, several periods of rapid food and cereal price increases following climate extremes in key producing regions indicate a sensitivity of current markets to climate extremes among other factors (medium con- ﬁdence). {WGII SPM A-1} At present the worldwide burden of human ill-health from cli- mate change is relatively small compared with effects of other stressors and is not well quantiﬁed. However, there has been increased heat-related mortality and decreased cold-related mortality in some regions as a result of warming (medium conﬁdence). Local changes in temperature and rainfall have altered the distribution of some water-borne illnesses and disease vectors (medium conﬁdence). {WGII SPM A-1} ‘Cascading’ impacts of climate change can now be attributed along chains of evidence from physical climate through to inter- mediate systems and then to people (Figure 1.12). The changes in climate feeding into the cascade, in some cases, are linked to human drivers (e.g., a decreasing amount of water in spring snowpack in west- ern North America), while, in other cases, assessments of the causes of observed climate change leading into the cascade are not available. In all cases, conﬁdence in detection and attribution to observed climate change decreases for effects further down each impact chain. {WGII 18.6.3} 51 Figure 1.12 | Major systems where new evidence indicates interconnected, ‘cascading’ impacts from recent climate change through several natural and human subsystems. Bracketed text indicates conﬁdence in the detection of a climate change effect and the attribution of observed impacts to climate change. The role of climate change can be major (solid arrow) or minor (dashed arrow). Initial evidence indicates that ocean acidiﬁcation is following similar trends with respect to impact on human systems as ocean warming. {WGII Figure 18-4} 52 Observed Changes and their Causes Topic 1 There is low conﬁdence in observed global-scale trends in droughts, due to lack of direct observations, dependencies of inferred trends on the choice of the deﬁnition for drought, and due to geographical inconsistencies in drought trends. There is also low conﬁdence in the attribution of changes in drought over global land areas since the mid-20th century, due to the same observa- tional uncertainties and difﬁculties in distinguishing decadal scale var- iability in drought from long-term trends. {WGI Table SPM.1, 2.6.2.3, 10.6, Figure 2.33, WGII 3.ES, 3.2.7} There is low conﬁdence that long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity are robust, and there is low conﬁdence in the attribution of global changes to any particular cause. However, it is virtually certain that intense tropical cyclone activity has increased in the North Atlantic since 1970. {WGI Table SPM.1, 2.6.3, 10.6} It is likely that extreme sea levels (for example, as experienced in storm surges) have increased since 1970, being mainly the result of mean sea level rise. Due to a shortage of studies and the difﬁculty of distinguishing any such impacts from other modiﬁcations to coastal systems, limited evidence is available on the impacts of sea level rise. {WGI 3.7.4–3.7.6, Figure 3.15, WGII 5.3.3.2, 18.3} n o i t c u d o r t n I 1 Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, ﬂoods, cyclones and wildﬁres, reveal signiﬁ- cant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability (very high conﬁ- dence). Impacts of such climate-related extremes include alteration of ecosystems, disruption of food production and water supply, damage to infrastructure and settlements, human morbidity and mortality and consequences for mental health and human well-being. For countries at all levels of development, these impacts are consistent with a sig- niﬁcant lack of preparedness for current climate variability in some sectors. {WGII SPM A-1, 3.2, 4.2-3, 8.1, 9.3, 10.7, 11.3, 11.7, 13.2, 14.1, 18.6, 22.2.3, 22.3, 23.3.1.2, 24.4.1, 25.6-8, 26.6-7, 30.5,Table 18-3, Table 23-1, Figure 26-2, Box 4-3, Box 4-4, Box 25-5, Box 25-6, Box 25-8, Box CC-CR} Direct and insured losses from weather-related disasters have increased substantially in recent decades, both globally and regionally. Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters (high conﬁdence). {WGII 10.7.3, SREX SPM B, 4.5.3.3} 1.4 Extreme events Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950. Some of these changes have been linked to human inﬂuences, includ- ing a decrease in cold temperature extremes, an increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in extreme high sea levels and an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions. It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely that human inﬂuence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human inﬂuence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. {WGI SPM B.1, SPM D.3, Table SPM.1, FAQ 2.2, 2.6.1, 10.6} There is medium conﬁdence that the observed warming has increased heat-related human mortality and decreased cold- related human mortality in some regions. Extreme heat events cur- rently result in increases in mortality and morbidity in North America (very high conﬁdence), and in Europe with impacts that vary according to people’s age, location and socio-economic factors (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM A-1, 11.4.1, Table 23-1, 26.6.1.2} There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events has likely increased in North America and Europe. In other continents, conﬁdence in trends is at most medium. It is very likely that global near-surface and tropospheric air speciﬁc humidity has increased since the 1970s. In land regions where observational coverage is sufﬁcient for assess- ment, there is medium conﬁdence that anthropogenic forcing has con- tributed to a global-scale intensiﬁcation of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century. {WGI SPM B-1, 2.5.1, 2.5.4–2.5.5, 2.6.2, 10.6, Table SPM.1, FAQ 2.2, SREX Table 3-1, 3.2} There is low conﬁdence that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of ﬂuvial ﬂoods on a global scale. The strength of the evidence is limited mainly by a lack of long-term records from unmanaged catchments. Moreover, ﬂoods are strongly inﬂuenced by many human activities impacting catchments, making the attribution of detected changes to climate change difﬁcult. However, recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharges in some catchments implies greater risks of ﬂooding on a regional scale (medium conﬁdence). Costs related to ﬂood damage, worldwide, have been increasing since the 1970s, although this is partly due to the increasing exposure of people and assets. {WGI 2.6.2, WGII 3.2.7, SREX SPM B} 53 Topic 1 Observed Changes and their Causes 1.5 Exposure and vulnerability 1.6 Human responses to climate change: adaptation and mitigation The character and severity of impacts from climate change and extreme events emerge from risk that depends not only on climate-related hazards but also on exposure (people and assets at risk) and vulner- ability (susceptibility to harm) of human and natural systems. Adaptation and mitigation experience is accumulating across regions and scales, even while global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase. Throughout history, people and societies have adjusted to and coped with climate, climate variability and extremes, with varying degrees of success. In today’s changing climate, accumulating experience with adaptation and mitigation efforts can provide opportunities for learn- ing and reﬁnement (3, 4). {WGII SPM A-2} Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning pro- cesses, with more limited implementation of responses (high conﬁdence). Engineered and technological options are commonly implemented adaptive responses, often integrated within existing pro- grammes, such as disaster risk management and water management. There is increasing recognition of the value of social, institutional and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints to adap- tation. {WGII SPM A-2, 4.4, 5.5, 6.4, 8.3, 9.4, 11.7, 14.1, 14.3–14.4, 15.2–15.5, 17.2–17.3, 21.3, 21.5, 22.4, 23.7, 25.4, 26.8–26.9, 30.6, Box 25-1, Box 25-2, Box 25-9, Box CC-EA} Governments at various levels have begun to develop adapta- tion plans and policies and integrate climate change consider- ations into broader development plans. Examples of adaptation are now available from all regions of the world (see Topic 4 for details on adaptation options and policies to support their implementation). {WGII SPM A-2, 22.4, 23.7, 24.4–24.6, 24.9, 25.4, 25.10, 26.7–26.9, 27.3, 28.2, 28.4, 29.3, 29.6, 30.6, Table 25-2, Table 29-3, Figure 29-1, Box 5-1, Box 23-3, Box 25-1, Box 25-2, Box 25-9, Box CC-TC} Global increases in anthropogenic emissions and climate impacts have occurred, even while mitigation activities have taken place in many parts of the world. Though various mitiga- tion initiatives between the sub-national and global scales have been developed or implemented, a full assessment of their impact may be premature. {WGIII SPM.3, SPM.5} 1 Exposure and vulnerability are inﬂuenced by a wide range of social, economic and cultural factors and processes that have been incompletely considered to date and that make quanti- tative assessments of their future trends difﬁcult (high conﬁ- dence). These factors include wealth and its distribution across soci- ety, demographics, migration, access to technology and information, employment patterns, the quality of adaptive responses, societal values, governance structures and institutions to resolve conﬂict. {WGII SPM A-3, SREX SPM B} Differences in vulnerability and exposure arise from non-climatic factors and from multidimensional inequalities often produced by uneven development processes (very high conﬁdence). These differences shape differential risks from climate change. People who are socially, economically, culturally, politically, institutionally or otherwise marginalized are especially vulnerable to climate change and also to some adaptation and mitigation responses (medium evidence, high agreement). This heightened vulnerability is rarely due to a single cause. Rather, it is the product of intersecting social processes that result in inequalities in socio-economic status and income, as well as in exposure. Such social processes include, for example, discrimination on the basis of gender, class, ethnicity, age and (dis)ability. {WGII SPM A-1, Figure SPM.1, 8.1–8.2, 9.3–9.4, 10.9, 11.1, 11.3–11.5, 12.2–12.5, 13.1–13.3, 14.1–14.3, 18.4, 19.6, 23.5, 25.8, 26.6, 26.8, 28.4, Box CC-GC} Climate-related hazards exacerbate other stressors, often with negative outcomes for livelihoods, especially for people living in poverty (high conﬁdence). Climate-related hazards affect poor people’s lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in crop yields or the destruction of homes, and indirectly through, for example, increased food prices and food insecurity. Observed positive effects for poor and marginalized people, which are limited and often indirect, include examples such as diversiﬁcation of social networks and of agricultural practices. {WGII SPM A-1, 8.2–8.3, 9.3, 11.3, 13.1– 13.3, 22.3, 24.4, 26.8} Violent conﬂict increases vulnerability to climate change (medium evidence, high agreement). Large-scale violent conﬂict harms assets that facilitate adaptation, including infrastructure, insti- tutions, natural resources, social capital and livelihood opportunities. {WGII SPM A-1, 12.5, 19.2, 19.6} 54 2 Future Climate Changes, Risks and Impacts n o i t c u d o r t n I 55 Topic 2 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Topic 2: Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limit- ing climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks. Topic 2 assesses projections of future climate change and the resulting risks and impacts. Factors that determine future climate change, including scenarios for future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, are outlined in Section 2.1. Descriptions of the methods and tools used to make projections of climate, impacts and risks, and their development since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), are provided in Boxes 2.1 to 2.3. Details of projected changes in the climate system, including the associated uncertainty and the degree of expert conﬁdence in the projections are provided in Section 2.2. The future impacts of climate change on natural and human systems and associated risks are assessed in Section 2.3. Topic 2 concludes with an assessment of irreversible changes, abrupt changes and changes beyond 2100 in Section 2.4. 2.1 Key drivers of future climate and the basis on which projections are made 2 Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Projections of greenhouse gas emissions vary over a wide range, depending on both socio-economic development and climate policy. Climate models are mathematical representations of processes impor- tant in the Earth’s climate system. Results from a hierarchy of climate models are considered in this report; ranging from simple idealized models, to models of intermediate complexity, to comprehensive Gen- eral Circulation Models (GCMs), including Earth System Models (ESMs) that also simulate the carbon cycle. The GCMs simulate many climate aspects, including the temperature of the atmosphere and the oceans, precipitation, winds, clouds, ocean currents and sea-ice extent. The models are extensively tested against historical observations (Box 2.1). {WGI 1.5.2, 9.1.2, 9.2, 9.8.1} In order to obtain climate change projections, the climate models use information described in scenarios of GHG and air pollutant emis- sions and land use patterns. Scenarios are generated by a range of approaches, from simple idealised experiments to Integrated Assess- ment Models (IAMs, see Glossary). Key factors driving changes in anthropogenic GHG emissions are economic and population growth, lifestyle and behavioural changes, associated changes in energy use and land use, technology and climate policy, which are fundamentally uncertain. {WGI 11.3, 12.4, WGIII 5, 6, 6.1} The standard set of scenarios used in the AR5 is called Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, Box 2.2). {WGI Box SPM.1} Box 2.1 | Advances, Conﬁdence and Uncertainty in Modelling the Earth’s Climate System Improvements in climate models since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) are evident in simulations of continental- scale surface temperature, large-scale precipitation, the monsoon, Arctic sea ice, ocean heat content, some extreme events, the carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry and aerosols, the effects of stratospheric ozone and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Climate models reproduce the observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and multi-decadal trends, includ- ing the more rapid warming since the mid-20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions (very high conﬁdence). The simulation of large-scale patterns of precipitation has improved somewhat since the AR4, although models continue to perform less well for precipitation than for surface temperature. Conﬁdence in the representation of processes involving clouds and aerosols remains low. {WGI SPM D.1, 7.2.3, 7.3.3, 7.6.2, 9.4, 9.5, 9.8, 10.3.1} The ability to simulate ocean thermal expansion, glaciers and ice sheets, and thus sea level, has improved since the AR4, but signiﬁcant challenges remain in representing the dynamics of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. This, together with advances in scientiﬁc understanding and capability, has resulted in improved sea level projections in this report, compared with the AR4. {WGI SPM E.6, 9.1.3, 9.2, 9.4.2, 9.6, 9.8, 13.1, 13.4, 13.5} There is overall consistency between the projections from climate models in AR4 and AR5 for large-scale patterns of change and the magnitude of the uncertainty has not changed signiﬁcantly, but new experiments and studies have led to a more complete and rigorous characterization of the uncertainty in long-term projections. {WGI 12.4} 56 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Topic 2 Box 2.2 | The Representative Concentration Pathways The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) describe four different 21st century pathways of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and atmospheric concentrations, air pollutant emissions and land use. The RCPs have been developed using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) as input to a wide range of climate model simulations to project their consequences for the cli- mate system. These climate projections, in turn, are used for impacts and adaptation assessment. The RCPs are consistent with the wide range of scenarios in the mitigation literature assessed by WGIII2820. The scenarios are used to assess the costs associated with emission reductions consistent with particular concentration pathways. The RCPs represent the range of GHG emissions in the wider literature well (Box 2.2, Figure 1); they include a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two intermediate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0), and one scenario with very high GHG emissions (RCP8.5). Scenarios without additional efforts to constrain emissions (‘baseline scenarios’) lead to pathways ranging between RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. RCP2.6 is representative of a scenario that aims to keep global warming likely below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. The majority of models indicate that scenarios meeting forcing levels similar to RCP2.6 are characterized by substantial net negative emissions2921 by 2100, on average around 2 GtCO2/yr. The land use scenarios of RCPs, together, show a wide range of possible futures, ranging from a net reforestation to further deforestation, consistent with projections in the full scenario literature. For air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), the RCP scenarios assume a consistent decrease in emissions as a consequence of assumed air pollution control and GHG mitigation policy (Box 2.2, Figure 1). Importantly, these future scenarios do not account for possible changes in natural forcings (e.g., volcanic eruptions) (see Box 1.1). {WGI Box SPM.1, 6.4, 8.5.3, 12.3, Annex II, WGII 19, 21, WGIII 6.3.2, 6.3.6} n o i t c u d o r t n I The RCPs cover a wider range than the scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) used in previous assessments, as they also represent scenarios with climate policy. In terms of overall forcing, RCP8.5 is broadly comparable to the SRES A2/A1FI scenario, RCP6.0 to B2 and RCP4.5 to B1. For RCP2.6, there is no equivalent scenario in SRES. As a result, the differ- ences in the magnitude of AR4 and AR5 climate projections are largely due to the inclusion of the wider range of emissions assessed. {WGI TS Box TS.6, 12.4.9} 2 Box 2.2, Figure 1 | Emission scenarios and the resulting radiative forcing levels for the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, lines) and the associated scenarios categories used in WGIII (coloured areas, see Table 3.1). Panels a to d show the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Panel e shows future radiative forcing levels for the RCPs calculated using the simple carbon cycle climate model, Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC), for the RCPs (per forcing agent) and for the WGIII scenario categories (total) {WGI 8.2.2, 8.5.3, Figure 8.2, Annex II, WGIII Table SPM.1, Table 6.3}. The WGIII scenario categories summarize the wide range of emission scenarios published in the scientiﬁc literature and are deﬁned based on total CO2-equivalent concentrations (in ppm) in 2100 (Table 3.1). The vertical lines to the right of the panels (panel a–d) indicate the full range of the WGIII AR5 scenario database. 28 Roughly 300 baseline scenarios and 900 mitigation scenarios are categorized by CO2-equivalent concentration (CO2-eq) by 2100. The CO2-eq includes the forcing due to all GHGs (including halogenated gases and tropospheric ozone), aerosols and albedo change (see Glossary). 29 Net negative emissions can be achieved when more GHGs are sequestered than are released into the atmosphere (e.g., by using bio-energy in combination with carbon dioxide capture and storage). 57 Topic 2 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts The methods used to estimate future impacts and risks resulting from climate change are described in Box 2.3. Modelled future impacts assessed in this report are generally based on climate-model projec- tions using the RCPs, and in some cases, the older Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). {WGI Box SPM.1, WGII 1.1, 1.3, 2.2–2.3, 19.6, 20.2, 21.3, 21.5, 26.2, Box CC-RC} Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction between climate-related hazards (including hazardous events and trends) and the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems. Alternative development paths inﬂuence risk by changing the likelihood of climatic events and trends, through their effects on GHGs, pollutants and land use, and by altering vulnerability and exposure. {WGII SPM, 19.2.4, Figure 19-1, Box 19-2} Experiments, observations and models used to estimate future impacts and risks have improved since the AR4, with increas- ing understanding across sectors and regions. For example, an improved knowledge base has enabled expanded assessment of risks for human security and livelihoods and for the oceans. For some aspects of climate change and climate change impacts, uncertainty about future outcomes has narrowed. For others, uncertainty will per- sist. Some of the persistent uncertainties are grounded in the mecha- nisms that control the magnitude and pace of climate change. Others emerge from potentially complex interactions between the changing climate and the underlying vulnerability and exposure of people, soci- eties and ecosystems. The combination of persistent uncertainty in key mechanisms plus the prospect of complex interactions motivates a focus on risk in this report. Because risk involves both probability 2 and consequence, it is important to consider the full range of possible outcomes, including low-probability, high-consequence impacts that are difﬁcult to simulate. {WGII 2.1–2.4, 3.6, 4.3, 11.3, 12.6, 19.2, 19.6, 21.3–21.5, 22.4, 25.3–25.4, 25.11, 26.2} 2.2 Projected changes in the climate system Surface temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century under all assessed emission scenarios. It is very likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer, and that extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent in many regions. The ocean will continue to warm and acidify, and global mean sea level to rise. The projected changes in Section 2.2 are for 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005, unless otherwise indicated. 2.2.1 Air temperature2021 The global mean surface temperature change for the period 2016– 2035 relative to 1986–2005 is similar for the four RCPs, and will likely be in the range 0.3°C to 0.7°C (medium conﬁdence)3022. This range assumes no major volcanic eruptions or changes in some natural sources (e.g., methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)), or unexpected changes in total solar irradiance. Future climate will depend on Box 2.3 | Models and Methods for Estimating Climate Change Risks, Vulnerability and Impacts Future climate-related risks, vulnerabilities and impacts are estimated in the AR5 through experiments, analogies and models, as in previous assessments. ‘Experiments’ involve deliberately changing one or more climate-system factors affecting a subject of interest to reﬂect anticipated future conditions, while holding the other factors affecting the subject constant. ‘Analogies’ make use of existing variations and are used when controlled experiments are impractical due to ethical constraints, the large area or long time required or high system complexity. Two types of analogies are used in projections of climate and impacts. Spatial analo- gies identify another part of the world currently experiencing similar conditions to those anticipated to be experienced in the future. Temporal analogies use changes in the past, sometimes inferred from paleo-ecological data, to make inferences about changes in the future. ‘Models’ are typically numerical simulations of real-world systems, calibrated and validated using observations from experi- ments or analogies, and then run using input data representing future climate. Models can also include largely descriptive narratives of possible futures, such as those used in scenario construction. Quantitative and descriptive models are often used together. Impacts are modelled, among other things, for water resources, biodiversity and ecosystem services on land, inland waters, the oceans and ice bodies, as well as for urban infrastructure, agricultural productivity, health, economic growth and poverty. {WGII 2.2.1, 2.4.2, 3.4.1, 4.2.2, 5.4.1, 6.5, 7.3.1, 11.3.6, 13.2.2} Risks are evaluated based on the interaction of projected changes in the Earth system with the many dimensions of vul- nerability in societies and ecosystems. The data are seldom sufﬁcient to allow direct estimation of probabilities of a given outcome; therefore, expert judgment using speciﬁc criteria (large magnitude, high probability or irreversibility of impacts; timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to reduce risks through adaptation or mitigation) is used to integrate the diverse information sources relating to the severity of consequences and the likelihood of occurrence into a risk evalu- ation, considering exposure and vulnerability in the context of speciﬁc hazards. {WGII 11.3, 19.2, 21.1, 21.3–21.5, 25.3–25.4, 25.11, 26.2} 30 The 1986–2005 period was approximately 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] °C warmer than the period 1850–1900. {WGI SPM E, 2.4.3} 58 59committed warming caused by past anthropogenic emissions, as well as future anthropogenic emissions and natural climate variability. By the mid-21st century, the magnitude of the projected climate change is substantially affected by the choice of emissions scenarios. Climate change continues to diverge among the scenarios through to 2100 and beyond (Table 2.1, Figure 2.1). The ranges provided for particular RCPs (Table 2.1), and those given below in Section 2.2, primarily arise from differences in the sensitivity of climate models to the imposed forcing. {WGI SPM E.1, 11.3.2, 12.4.1}Figure 2.1 | (a) Time series of global annual change in mean surface temperature for the 1900–2300 period (relative to 1986–2005) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) concentration-driven experiments. Projections are shown for the multi-model mean (solid lines) and the 5 to 95% range across the distribution of individual models (shading). Grey lines and shading represent the CMIP5 historical simulations. Discontinuities at 2100 are due to different numbers of models performing the extension runs beyond the 21st century and have no physical meaning.

(e) Change in ocean surface pH. For all panels, time series of projections and a measure of uncertainty (shading) are shown for scenarios RCP2.6 (blue) and RCP8.5 (red). The number of CMIP5 models used to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated. The mean and associated uncertainties averaged over the 2081–2100 period are given for all RCP scenarios as coloured vertical bars on the right hand side of panels (b) to (e). For sea-ice extent (c), the projected mean and uncertainty (minimum– maximum range) is only given for the subset of models that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and the 1979–2012 trend in the Arctic sea ice. For sea level (d), based on current understanding (from observations, physical understanding and modelling), only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. However, there is medium conﬁdence that this additional contribution would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century. {WGI Figure SPM.7, Figure SPM.9, Figure 12.5, 6.4.4, 12.4.1, 13.4.4, 13.5.1} Topic 2 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Notes: a Based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble; changes calculated with respect to the 1986–2005 period. Using Hadley Centre Climatic Research Unit Gridded Surface Temperature Data Set 4 (HadCRUT4) and its uncertainty estimate (5 to 95% conﬁdence interval), the observed warming from 1850–1900 to the reference period 1986–2005 is 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] °C. Likely ranges have not been assessed here with respect to earlier reference periods because methods are not gen- erally available in the literature for combining the uncertainties in models and observations. Adding projected and observed changes does not account for potential effects of model biases compared to observations, and for natural internal variability during the observational reference period. {WGI 2.4.3, 11.2.2, 12.4.1, Table 12.2, Table 12.3} b Based on 21 CMIP5 models; changes calculated with respect to the 1986–2005 period. Based on current understanding (from observations, physical understanding and modelling), only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. There is medium conﬁdence that this additional contribution would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century. 2 c Calculated from projections as 5 to 95% model ranges. These ranges are then assessed to be likely ranges after accounting for additional uncertainties or different levels of conﬁdence in models. For projections of global mean surface temperature change in 2046–2065, conﬁdence is medium, because the relative importance of natural internal variability, and uncertainty in non-greenhouse gas forcing and response, are larger than for the 2081–2100 period. The likely ranges for 2046–2065 do not take into account the possible inﬂuence of factors that lead to the assessed range for near term (2016–2035) change in global mean surface temperature that is lower than the 5 to 95% model range, because the inﬂuence of these factors on longer term projections has not been quantiﬁed due to insufﬁcient scientiﬁc understanding. {WGI 11.3.1} d Calculated from projections as 5 to 95% model ranges. These ranges are then assessed to be likely ranges after accounting for additional uncertainties or different levels of conﬁdence in models. For projections of global mean sea level rise conﬁdence is medium for both time horizons. Relative to 1850–1900, global surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) is projected to likely exceed 1.5°C for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high conﬁdence). Warming is likely to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high conﬁdence), more likely than not to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5 (medium conﬁdence), but unlikely to exceed 2°C for RCP2.6 (medium conﬁdence). {WGI SPM E.1, 12.4.1, Table 12.3} The Arctic region will continue to warm more rapidly than the global mean (Figure 2.2) (very high conﬁdence). The mean warming over land will be larger than over the ocean (very high conﬁdence) and larger than global average warming (Figure 2.2). {WGI SPM E.1, 11.3.2, 12.4.3, 14.8.2} It is virtually certain that there will be more frequent hot and fewer cold temperature extremes over most land areas on daily and seasonal timescales, as global mean surface temperature increases. It is very likely that heat waves will occur with a higher frequency and longer duration. Occasional cold winter extremes will continue to occur. {WGI SPM E.1, 12.4.3} 2.2.2 Water cycle the RCP8.5 scenario. In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely increase under the RCP8.5 sce- nario (Figure 2.2). {WGI SPM E.2, 7.6.2, 12.4.5, 14.3.1, 14.3.5} Extreme precipitation events over most mid-latitude land masses and over wet tropical regions will very likely become more intense and more frequent as global mean surface temperature increases. {WGI SPM E.2, 7.6.2, 12.4.5} Globally, in all RCPs, it is likely that the area encompassed by monsoon systems will increase and monsoon precipitation is likely to intensify and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related precipitation varia- bility on regional scales will likely intensify. {WGI SPM E.2, 14.2, 14.4} 2.2.3 Ocean, cryosphere and sea level The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century. The strongest ocean warming is projected for the surface in tropical and Northern Hemisphere subtropical regions. At greater depth the warming will be most pronounced in the Southern Ocean (high conﬁ- dence). {WGI SPM E.4, 6.4.5, 12.4.7} Changes in precipitation in a warming world will not be uniform. The high latitudes and the equatorial Paciﬁc are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation by the end of this century under It is very likely that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Cir- culation (AMOC) will weaken over the 21st century, with best estimates and model ranges for the reduction of 11% (1 to 24%) for 60 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Topic 2 Figure 2.2 | Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model mean projections (i.e., the average of the model projections available) for the 2081–2100 period under the RCP2.6 (left) and RCP8.5 (right) scenarios for (a) change in annual mean surface temperature and (b) change in annual mean precipitation, in percentages, and (c) change in average sea level. Changes are shown relative to the 1986–2005 period. The number of CMIP5 models used to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated in the upper right corner of each panel. Stippling (dots) on (a) and (b) indicates regions where the projected change is large compared to natural internal variability (i.e., greater than two standard deviations of internal variability in 20-year means) and where 90% of the models agree on the sign of change. Hatching (diagonal lines) on (a) and (b) shows regions where the projected change is less than one standard deviation of natural internal variability in 20-year means. {WGI Figure SPM.8, Figure 13.20, Box 12.1} 61 Topic 2 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts the RCP2.6 scenario, 34% (12 to 54%) for the RCP8.5. Nevertheless, it is very unlikely that the AMOC will undergo an abrupt transition or collapse in the 21st century. {WGI SPM E.4, 12.4.7.2} continued land carbon uptake under all RCPs, but some models simulate a land carbon loss due to the combined effect of climate change and land use change. {WGI SPM E.7, 6.4.2, 6.4.3} Year-round reductions in Arctic sea ice are projected for all RCP scenarios. The subset of models that most closely reproduce the obser- vations3123 project that a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean3224 in September is likely for RCP8.5 before mid-century (medium conﬁdence) (Figure 2.1). In the Antarctic, a decrease in sea ice extent and volume is projected with low conﬁdence. {WGI SPM E.5, 12.4.6.1} Based on Earth System Models, there is high conﬁdence that the feedback between climate change and the carbon cycle will amplify global warming. Climate change will partially offset increases in land and ocean carbon sinks caused by rising atmospheric CO2. As a result more of the emitted anthropogenic CO2 will remain in the atmos- phere, reinforcing the warming. {WGI SPM E.7, 6.4.2, 6.4.3} The area of Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover is likely to decrease by 7% for RCP2.6 and by 25% in RCP8.5 by the end of the 21st century for the multi-model average (medium conﬁdence). {WGI SPM E.5, 12.4.6} It is virtually certain that near-surface permafrost extent at high northern latitudes will be reduced as global mean surface tem- perature increases. The area of permafrost near the surface (upper 3.5 m) is likely to decrease by 37% (RCP2.6) to 81% (RCP8.5) for the multi-model average (medium conﬁdence). {WGI SPM E.5, 12.4.6} 2 The global glacier volume, excluding glaciers on the periphery of Ant- arctica (and excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets), is pro- jected to decrease by 15 to 55% for RCP2.6 and by 35 to 85% for RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). {WGI SPM E.5, 13.4.2, 13.5.1} Earth System Models project a global increase in ocean acidiﬁ- cation for all RCP scenarios by the end of the 21st century, with a slow recovery after mid-century under RCP2.6. The decrease in surface ocean pH is in the range of 0.06 to 0.07 (15 to 17% increase in acidity) for RCP2.6, 0.14 to 0.15 (38 to 41%) for RCP4.5, 0.20 to 0.21 (58 to 62%) for RCP6.0, and 0.30 to 0.32 (100 to 109%) for RCP8.5 (Figure 2.1). {WGI SPM E.7, 6.4.4} It is very likely that the dissolved oxygen content of the ocean will decrease by a few percent during the 21st century in response to surface warming, predominantly in the subsurface mid-latitude oceans. There is no consensus on the future volume of low oxygen waters in the open ocean because of large uncertainties in potential biogeochemical effects and in the evolution of tropical ocean dynamics. {WGI TS 5.6, 6.4.5, WGII TS B-2, 6.1} Global mean sea level will continue to rise during the 21st cen- tury (Table 2.1, Figure 2.1). There has been signiﬁcant improvement in understanding and projection of sea level change since the AR4. Under all RCP scenarios, the rate of sea level rise will very likely exceed the observed rate of 2.0 [1.7–2.3] mm/yr during 1971–2010, with the rate of rise for RCP8.5 during 2081–2100 of 8 to 16 mm/yr (medium conﬁdence). {WGI SPM B4, SPM E.6, 13.5.1} Sea level rise will not be uniform across regions. By the end of the 21st century, it is very likely that sea level will rise in more than about 95% of the ocean area. Sea level rise depends on the pathway of CO2 emissions, not only on the cumulative total; reducing emissions earlier rather than later, for the same cumulative total, leads to a larger mitigation of sea level rise. About 70% of the coastlines worldwide are projected to experience sea level change within ±20% of the global mean (Figure 2.2). It is very likely that there will be a signiﬁcant increase in the occurrence of future sea level extremes in some regions by 2100. {WGI SPM E.6, TS 5.7.1, 12.4.1, 13.4.1, 13.5.1, 13.6.5, 13.7.2, Table 13.5} 2.2.4 Carbon cycle and biogeochemistry Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 will continue under all four RCPs through to 2100, with higher uptake for higher concen- tration pathways (very high conﬁdence). The future evolution of the land carbon uptake is less certain. A majority of models projects a 31 Climatological mean state and the 1979–2012 trend in Arctic sea-ice extent. 32 When sea-ice extent is less than one million km2 for at least ﬁve consecutive years. 2.2.5 Climate system responses Climate system properties that determine the response to external forcing have been estimated both from climate models and from anal- ysis of past and recent climate change. The equilibrium climate sensi- tivity (ECS)3325 is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C, extremely unlikely less than 1°C, and very unlikely greater than 6°C. {WGI SPM D.2, TS TFE.6, 10.8.1, 10.8.2, 12.5.4, Box 12.2} Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean sur- face warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Multiple lines of evidence indicate a strong and consistent near-linear relationship across all scenarios considered between net cumulative CO2 emissions (includ- ing the impact of CO2 removal) and projected global temperature change to the year 2100 (Figure 2.3). Past emissions and observed warming sup- port this relationship within uncertainties. Any given level of warming is associated with a range of cumulative CO2 emissions (depending on non-CO2 drivers), and therefore, for example, higher emissions in earlier decades imply lower emissions later. {WGI SPM E.8, TS TFE.8, 12.5.4} The global mean peak surface temperature change per trillion tonnes of carbon (1000 GtC) emitted as CO2 is likely in the range of 0.8°C to 2.5°C. This quantity, called the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE), is supported by both modelling and observational evidence and applies to cumulative emissions up to about 2000 GtC. {WGI SPM D.2, TS TFE.6, 12.5.4, Box 12.2} 33 Deﬁned as the equilibrium global average surface warming following a doubling of CO2 concentration (relative to pre-industrial). 62 63Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Topic 2Warming caused by CO2 emissions is effectively irreversible over multi-century timescales unless measures are taken to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Ensuring CO2-induced warming remains likely less than 2°C requires cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources to remain below about 3650 GtCO2 (1000 GtC), over half of which were already emitted by 2011. {WGI SPM E.8, TS TFE.8, 12.5.2, 12.5.3, 12.5.4}Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming (accounting for both CO2 and other human inﬂuences on climate) to less than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66% would require total CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources since 1870 to be limited to about 2900 GtCO2 when accounting for non-CO2 forcing as in the RCP2.6 scenario, with a range of 2550 to 3150 GtCO2 arising from variations in non-CO2 climate drivers across the scenarios considered by WGIII (Table 2.2). About 1900 [1650 to 2150] GtCO2 were emitted by 2011, leaving about 1000 GtCO2 to be consistent with this temperature goal. Estimated total fossil carbon reserves exceed this remaining amount by a factor of 4 to 7, with resources much larger still. {WGI SPM E.8, TS TFE.8, Figure 1, TS.SM.10, 12.5.4, Figure 12.45, WGIII Table SPM.1, Table 6.3, Table 7.2}Figure 2.3 | Global mean surface temperature increase as a function of cumulative total global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from various lines of evidence. Multi-model results from a hierarchy of climate carbon-cycle models for each Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) until 2100 are shown (coloured lines). Model results over the historical period (1860 to 2010) are indicated in black. The coloured plume illustrates the multi-model spread over the four RCP scenarios and fades with the decreasing number of available models in RCP8.5. Dots indicate decadal averages, with selected decades labelled. Ellipses show total anthropogenic warming in 2100 versus cumulative CO2 emissions from 1870 to 2100 from a simple climate model (median climate response) under the scenario categories used in WGIII. Temperature values are always given relative to the 1861–1880 period, and emissions are cumulative since 1870. Black ﬁlled ellipse shows observed emissions to 2005 and observed temperatures in the decade 2000–2009 with associated uncertainties. {WGI SPM E.8, TS TFE.8, Figure 1, TS.SM.10, 12.5.4, Figure 12.45, WGIII Table SPM.1, Table 6.3} Topic 2 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Notes: a Warming due to CO2 and non-CO2 drivers. Temperature values are given relative to the 1861–1880 base period. b Note that the 66% range in this table should not be equated to the likelihood statements in Table SPM.1 and Table 3.1 and WGIII Table SPM.1. The assessment in these latter tables is not only based on the probabilities calculated for the full ensemble of scenarios in WGIII using a single climate model, but also the assessment in WGI of the uncertainty of the temperature projections not covered by climate models. 2 c Cumulative CO2 emissions at the time the temperature threshold is exceeded that are required for 66%, 50% or 33% of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) complex models Earth System Model (ESM) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC) simulations, assuming non-CO2 forcing follows the RCP8.5 scenario. Similar cumulative emissions are implied by other RCP scenarios. For most scenario–threshold combinations, emissions and warming continue after the threshold is exceeded. Nevertheless, because of the cumulative nature of CO2 emissions, these ﬁgures provide an indication of the cumulative CO2 emissions implied by the CMIP5 model simulations under RCP-like scenarios. Values are rounded to the nearest 50. d Cumulative CO2 emissions at the time of peak warming from WGIII scenarios for which a fraction of greater than 66% (66 to 100%), greater than 50% (50 to 66%) or greater than 33% (33 to 50%) of climate simulations keep global mean temperature increase to below the stated threshold. Ranges indicate the variation in cumulative CO2 emissions arising from differences in non-CO2 drivers across the WGIII scenarios. The fraction of climate simulations for each scenario is derived from a 600-member parameter ensemble of a simple carbon-cycle climate model, Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC), in a probabilistic mode. Parameter and scenario uncertainty are explored in this ensemble. Structural uncertainties cannot be explored with a single model set-up. Ranges show the impact of scenario uncertainty, with 80% of scenarios giving cumulative CO2 emissions within the stated range for the given fraction of simulations. Simple model estimates are constrained by observed changes over the past century, do not account for uncertainty in model structure and may omit some feedback processes: they are hence slightly higher than the CMIP5 complex models estimates. Values are rounded to the nearest 50. e The numerical results for the cumulative CO2 emissions for staying below 3°C with greater than 66% (66 to 100%) is greatly inﬂuenced by a large number of scenarios that would also meet the 2°C objective and therefore not comparable with numbers provided for the other temperature threshold. f Reserves are quantities able to be recovered under existing economic and operating conditions; resources are those where economic extraction is potentially feasible. {WGIII Table 7.2} 2.3 Future risks and impacts caused by a changing climate Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development. Increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people, species and ecosystems. Continued high emissions would lead to mostly negative impacts for biodiversity, ecosystem services and economic development and amplify risks for livelihoods and for food and human security. Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of cli- mate-related hazards (including hazardous events and trends) with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, including 64 their ability to adapt. Rising rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidiﬁca- tion, increase the risk of severe, pervasive, and in some cases, irrevers- ible detrimental impacts. Future climate change will amplify existing climate-related risks and create new risks. {WGII SPM B, Figure SPM.1} Key risks are potentially severe impacts relevant to understanding dan- gerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Risks are considered key due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and systems exposed, or both. Their identiﬁcation is based on large magni- tude or high probability of impacts; irreversibility or timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability or exposure; or limited potential to reduce risks. Some risks are particularly relevant for individual regions (Figure 2.4), while others are global (Table 2.3). For risk assessment it is important to evaluate the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. Risk levels often increase with temperature (Box 2.4) and are sometimes more directly linked to other dimensions of climate change, such as the rate of warming, as well as the magnitudes and rates of ocean acidiﬁcation and sea level rise (Figure 2.5). {WGII SPM A-3, SPM B-1} 65Key risks that span sectors and regions include the following (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM B-1}:1. Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods resulting from storm surges, sea level rise and coastal ﬂooding; inland ﬂooding in some urban regions; and periods of extreme heat.2. Systemic risks due to extreme weather events leading to break-down of infrastructure networks and critical services.3. Risk of food and water insecurity and loss of rural livelihoods and income, particularly for poorer populations.4. Risk of loss of ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem goods, func-tions and services. The overall risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidiﬁcation. Some risks are considerable even at 1°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels. Many global risks are high to very high for global temperature increases of 4°C or more (see Box 2.4). These risks include severe and wide-spread impacts on unique and threatened systems, the extinction of many species, large risks to food security and compromised normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas for parts of the year, due to the combination of high temperature and humidity (high conﬁdence). The precise levels of climate change sufﬁcient to trigger abrupt and irreversible change remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds in the earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with rising temperature (medium conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B-1}Figure 2.4 | Representative key risks for each region, including the potential for risk reduction through adaptation and mitigation, as well as limits to adaptation. Identiﬁcation of key risks was based on expert judgment using the following speciﬁc criteria: large magnitude, high probability or irreversibility of impacts; timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to reduce risks through adaptation or mitigation. Risk levels are assessed as very low, low, medium, high or very high for three timeframes: the present, near term (here, for 2030–2040) and long term (here, for 2080–2100). In the near term, projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially across different emission scenarios. For the long term, risk levels are presented for two possible futures (2°C and 4°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels). For each time frame, risk levels are indicated for a continuation of current adaptation and assuming high levels of current or future adaptation. Risk levels are not necessarily comparable, especially across regions. {WGII SPM Assessment Box SPM.2 Table 1} 6 6 2 Figure 2.5 | The risks of: (a) disruption of the community composition of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems due to the rate of warming; (b) marine organisms impacted by ocean acidiﬁcation (OA) or warming extremes combined with OA; and (c) coastal human and natural systems impacted by sea level rise. The risk level criteria are consistent with those used in Box 2.4 and their calibration is illustrated by the annotations to each panel. (a) At high rates of warming, major groups of terrestrial and freshwater species are unable to move fast enough to stay within the spatially shifting climate envelopes to which they are adapted. The median observed or modelled speeds at which species populations move (km/ decade) are compared against the speed at which climate envelopes move across the landscape, given the projected climate change rates for each Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) over the 2050–2090 period. The results are presented for the average of all landscapes, globally, as well as for ﬂat landscapes, where the climate envelope moves especially fast. (b) Sensitivity to ocean acidiﬁcation is high in marine organisms building a calcium carbonate shell. The risks from OA increase with warming because OA lowers the tolerated levels of heat exposure, as seen in corals and crustaceans. (c) The height of a 50-year ﬂood event has already increased in many coastal locations. A 10- to more than 100-fold increase in the frequency of ﬂoods in many places would result from a 0.5 m rise in sea level in the absence of adaptation. Local adaptation capacity (and, in particular, protection) reaches its limits for ecosystems and human systems in many places under a 1 m sea level rise.

The potential for adaptation, as well as constraints and limits to adaptation, varies among sectors, regions, communities and ecosystems. The scope for adaptation changes over time and is closely linked to socio-economic development pathways and circumstances. See Figure 2.4 and Table 2.3, along with Topics 3 and 4. {WGII SPM B, SPM C, TS B, TS C} 2.3.1 Ecosystems and their services in the oceans, along coasts, on land and in freshwater Risks of harmful impacts on ecosystems and human systems increase with the rates and magnitudes of warming, ocean acidiﬁcation, sea level rise and other dimensions of climate change (high conﬁdence). Future risk is indicated to be high by the observation that natural global climate change at rates lower than current anthropogenic climate change caused signiﬁcant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years on land and in the oceans (high conﬁdence). Many plant and animal species will be unable to adapt locally or move fast enough during the 21st century to track suitable climates under mid- and high range rates of climate change (RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) (medium conﬁdence) (Figure 2.5a). Coral reefs and polar ecosystems are highly vulnerable. {WGII SPM A-1, SPM B-2, 4.3–4, 5.4, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, 25.6, 26.4, 29.4, Box CC-CR, Box CC-MB, Box CC-RF} A large fraction of terrestrial, freshwater and marine species faces increased extinction risk due to climate change during and beyond the 21st century, especially as climate change interacts with other stressors (high conﬁdence). Extinction risk is increased relative to pre-industrial and present periods, under all RCP scenarios, as a result of both the magnitude and rate of climate change (high conﬁdence). Extinctions will be driven by several climate-associated drivers (warming, sea-ice loss, variations in precipitation, reduced river ﬂows, ocean acidiﬁcation and lowered ocean oxygen levels) and the interactions among these drivers and their interaction with simul- taneous habitat modiﬁcation, over-exploitation of stocks, pollution, eutrophication and invasive species (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B-2, 4.3–4.4, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, 25.6, 26.4, Box CC-RF, Box CC-MB} Global marine species redistribution and marine biodiversity reduction in sensitive regions, under climate change, will chal- lenge the sustained provision of ﬁsheries productivity and other ecosystem services, especially at low latitudes (high con- ﬁdence). By the mid-21st century, under 2°C global warming rela- tive to pre-industrial temperatures, shifts in the geographical range of marine species will cause species richness and ﬁsheries catch potential to increase, on average, at mid and high latitudes (high con- ﬁdence) and to decrease at tropical latitudes and in semi-enclosed seas (Figure 2.6a) (medium conﬁdence). The progressive expansion of Oxygen Minimum Zones and anoxic ‘dead zones’ in the oceans will further constrain ﬁsh habitats (medium conﬁdence). Open-ocean net primary production is projected to redistribute and to decrease globally, by 2100, under all RCP scenarios (medium conﬁdence). Climate change adds to the threats of over-ﬁshing and other non-climatic stressors (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B-2, 6.3–6.5, 7.4, 25.6, 28.3, 29.3, 30.6–30.7, Box CC-MB, Box CC-PP} Marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs and polar ecosystems, are at risk from ocean acidiﬁcation (medium to high conﬁdence). Ocean acidiﬁcation has impacts on the physiology, behaviour and pop- ulation dynamics of organisms. The impacts on individual species and the number of species affected in species groups increase from RCP4.5 to RCP8.5. Highly calciﬁed molluscs, echinoderms and reef-building corals are more sensitive than crustaceans (high conﬁdence) and ﬁshes (low conﬁdence) (Figure 2.6b). Ocean acidiﬁcation acts together with other global changes (e.g., warming, progressively lower oxygen levels) and with local changes (e.g., pollution, eutrophication) (high conﬁdence), leading to interactive, complex and ampliﬁed impacts for species and ecosystems (Figure 2.5b). {WGII SPM B-2, Figure SPM.6B, 5.4, 6.3.2, 6.3.5, 22.3, 25.6, 28.3, 30.5, Figure 6-10, Box CC-CR, Box CC-OA, Box TS.7} Carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere is susceptible to loss to the atmosphere as a result of climate change, deforestation and ecosystem degradation (high conﬁdence). The aspects of cli- mate change with direct effects on stored terrestrial carbon include high temperatures, drought and windstorms; indirect effects include increased risk of ﬁres, pest and disease outbreaks. Increased tree mortality and associated forest dieback is projected to occur in many regions over the 21st century (medium conﬁdence), posing risks for carbon storage, biodiversity, wood production, water quality, amen- ity and economic activity. There is a high risk of substantial carbon and methane emissions as a result of permafrost thawing. {WGII SPM, 4.2–4.3, Figure 4-8, Box 4-2, Box 4-3, Box 4-4} Coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience submergence, ﬂooding and erosion throughout the 21st century and beyond, due to sea level rise (very high conﬁdence). The population and assets projected to be exposed to coastal risks as well as human pressures on coastal ecosystems will increase signiﬁcantly in the coming decades due to population growth, economic development and urbanization (high conﬁdence). Climatic and non-climatic drivers affecting coral reefs will erode habitats, increase coastline exposure to waves and storms and degrade environmental features important to ﬁsheries and tourism (high conﬁdence). Some low-lying develop- ing countries and small island states are expected to face very high impacts that could have associated damage and adaptation costs of several percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP) (Figure 2.5c). {WGII 5.3–5.5, 22.3, 24.4, 25.6, 26.3, 26.8, 29.4, Table 26-1, Box 25-1, Box CC-CR} 2.3.2 Water, food and urban systems, human health, security and livelihoods The fractions of the global population that will experience water scarcity and be affected by major river ﬂoods are pro- jected to increase with the level of warming in the 21st century (robust evidence, high agreement). {WGII 3.4–3.5, 26.3, 29.4, Table 3-2, Box 25-8} 67 Figure 2.6 | Climate change risks for ﬁsheries.

(b) Marine mollusc and crustacean ﬁsheries (present-day estimated annual catch rates ≥0.005 tonnes/km2) and known locations of cold- and warm-water corals, depicted on a global map showing the projected distribution of surface ocean acidiﬁcation by 2100 under RCP8.5. The bottom panel compares the percentage of species sensitive to ocean acidiﬁcation for corals, molluscs and crustaceans, vulnerable animal phyla with socio-economic relevance (e.g., for coastal protection and ﬁsheries). The number of species analysed across studies is given on top of the bars for each category of elevated CO2. For 2100, RCP scenarios falling within each pCO2 category are as follows: RCP4.5 for 500 to 650 μatm, RCP6.0 for 651 to 850 μatm and RCP8.5 for 851 to 1370 μatm. By 2150, RCP8.5 falls within the 1371 to 2900 μatm category. The control category corresponds to 380 μatm (The unit μatm is approximately equivalent to ppm in the atmosphere). {WGI Figure SPM.8, Box SPM.1, WGII SPM B-2, Figure SPM.6, 6.1, 6.3, 30.5, Figure 6-10 , Figure 6-14} 68 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Topic 2 Climate change over the 21st century is projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions (robust evidence, high agreement), intensifying competition for water among sectors (limited evi- dence, medium agreement). In presently dry regions, the frequency of droughts will likely increase by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). In contrast, water resources are pro- jected to increase at high latitudes (robust evidence, high agreement). The interaction of increased temperature; increased sediment, nutrient and pollutant loadings from heavy rainfall; increased concentrations of pollutants during droughts; and disruption of treatment facilities during ﬂoods will reduce raw water quality and pose risks to drinking water quality (medium evidence, high agreement). {WGI 12.4, WGII 3.2, 3.4–3.6, 22.3, 23.9, 25.5, 26.3, Table 3-2, Table 23-3, Box 25-2, Box CC-RF, Box CC-WE} All aspects of food security are potentially affected by climate change, including food production, access, use and price sta- bility (high conﬁdence). For wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production at local temperature increases of 2°C or more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may beneﬁt (medium conﬁdence). Projected impacts vary across crops and regions and adaptation scenarios, with about 10% of projections for the 2030–2049 period showing yield gains of more than 10%, and about 10% of projections showing yield losses of more than 25%, com- pared with the late 20th century. Global temperature increases of ~4°C or more above late 20th century levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose large risks to food security, both globally and regionally (high conﬁdence) (Figure 2.4, 2.7). The relationship between global and regional warming is explained in 2.2.1. {WGII 6.3–6.5, 7.4–7.5, 9.3, 22.3, 24.4, 25.7, 26.5, Table 7-2, Table 7-3, Figure 7-1, Figure 7-4, Figure 7-5, Figure 7-6, Figure 7-7, Figure 7-8, Box 7-1} Until mid-century, projected climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist (very high conﬁdence). Throughout the 21st century, n o i t c u d o r t n I climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions and especially in developing countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change (high conﬁdence). Health impacts include greater likelihood of injury and death due to more intense heat waves and ﬁres, increased risks from foodborne and waterborne diseases and loss of work capacity and reduced labour productivity in vulnerable populations (high conﬁ- dence). Risks of undernutrition in poor regions will increase (high con- ﬁdence). Risks from vector-borne diseases are projected to generally increase with warming, due to the extension of the infection area and season, despite reductions in some areas that become too hot for dis- ease vectors (medium conﬁdence). Globally, the magnitude and sever- ity of negative impacts will increasingly outweigh positive impacts (high conﬁdence). By 2100 for RCP8.5, the combination of high tem- perature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is expected to compromise common human activities, including growing food and working outdoors (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B-2, 8.2, 11.3–11.8, 19.3, 22.3, 25.8, 26.6, Figure 25-5, Box CC-HS} In urban areas, climate change is projected to increase risks for people, assets, economies and ecosystems, including risks from heat stress, storms and extreme precipitation, inland and coastal ﬂooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, water scarcity, sea level rise and storm surges (very high conﬁdence). These risks will be ampliﬁed for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living in exposed areas. {WGII 3.5, 8.2–8.4, 22.3, 24.4–24.5, 26.8, Table 8-2, Box 25-9, Box CC-HS} 2 Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and agricultural incomes, including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world (high conﬁdence). These impacts will disproportionately affect the wel- fare of the poor in rural areas, such as female-headed households and those with limited access to land, modern agricultural inputs, infrastructure and education. {WGII 5.4, 9.3, 25.9, 26.8, 28.2, 28.4, Box 25-5} Figure 2.7 | Summary of projected changes in crop yields (mostly wheat, maize, rice and soy) due to climate change over the 21st century. The ﬁgure combines 1090 data points from crop model projections, covering different emission scenarios, tropical and temperate regions and adaptation and no-adaptation cases. The projections are sorted into the 20-year periods (horizontal axis) during which their midpoint occurs. Changes in crop yields are relative to late 20th century levels and data for each time period sum to 100%. Relatively few studies have considered impacts on cropping systems for scenarios where global mean temperatures increase by 4°C or more. {WGII Figure SPM.7} 69 Topic 2 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Table 2.3 | Examples of global key risks for different sectors, including the potential for risk reduction through adaptation and mitigation, as well as limits to adaptation. Each key risk is assessed as very low, low, medium, high or very high. Risk levels are presented for three time frames: present, near term (here, for 2030–2040) and long term (here, for 2080–2100). In the near term, projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially across different emission scenarios. For the long term, risk levels are presented for two possible futures (2°C and 4°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels). For each time frame, risk levels are indicated for a continuation of current adaptation and assuming high levels of current or future adaptation. Risk levels are not necessarily comparable, especially across regions. Relevant climate variables are indicated by icons. {WGII Table TS.4} Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Topic 2 71 Topic 2 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts Box 2.4 | Reasons For Concern Regarding Climate Change Five Reasons For Concern (RFCs) have provided a framework for summarizing key risks since the IPCC Third Assessment Report. They illustrate the implications of warming and of adaptation limits for people, economies and ecosystems across sectors and regions. They provide one starting point for evaluating dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. All warming levels in the text of Box 2.4 are relative to the 1986–2005 period. Adding ~0.6°C to these warming levels roughly gives warming relative to the 1850–1900 period, used here as a proxy for pre-industrial times (right-hand scale in Box 2.4, Figure 1). {WGII Assessment Box SPM.1} The ﬁve RFCs are associated with: 1. Unique and threatened systems: Some ecosystems and cultures are already at risk from climate change (high conﬁdence). With additional warming of around 1°C, the number of unique and threatened systems at risk of severe consequences increases. Many systems with limited adaptive capacity, particularly those associated with Arctic sea ice and coral reefs, are subject to very high risks with additional warming of 2°C. In addition to risks resulting from the magnitude of warming, terrestrial species are also sensitive to the rate of warming, marine species to the rate and degree of ocean acidiﬁcation and coastal systems to sea level rise (Figure 2.5). 2. Extreme weather events: Climate change related risks from extreme events, such as heat waves, heavy precipitation and coastal ﬂooding, are already moderate (high conﬁdence). With 1°C additional warming, risks are high (medium conﬁdence). Risks associated with some types of extreme events (e.g., extreme heat) increase progressively with further warming (high conﬁdence). 2 3. Distribution of impacts: Risks are unevenly distributed between groups of people and between regions; risks are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities everywhere. Risks are already moderate because of regional differences in observed climate change impacts, particularly for crop production (medium to high conﬁdence). Based on projected decreases in regional crop yields and water availability, risks of unevenly distributed impacts are high under additional warming of above 2°C (medium conﬁdence). 4. Global aggregate impacts: Risks of global aggregate impacts are moderate under additional warming of between 1°C and 2°C, reﬂecting impacts on both the Earth’s biodiversity and the overall global economy (medium conﬁdence). Extensive biodiversity loss, with associated loss of ecosystem goods and services, leads to high risks at around 3°C additional warming (high conﬁdence). Aggregate economic damages accelerate with increasing temperature (limited evidence, high agreement), but few quantitative estimates are available for additional warming of above 3°C. 5. Large-scale singular events: With increasing warming, some physical and ecological systems are at risk of abrupt and/or irre- versible changes (see Section 2.4). Risks associated with such tipping points are moderate between 0 and 1°C additional warming, since there are signs that both warm-water coral reefs and Arctic ecosystems are already experiencing irreversible regime shifts (medium conﬁdence). Risks increase at a steepening rate under an additional warming of 1 to 2°C and become high above 3°C, due to the potential for large and irreversible sea level rise from ice sheet loss. For sustained warming above some threshold greater than ~0.5°C additional warming (low conﬁdence) but less than ~3.5°C (medium conﬁdence), near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet would occur over a millennium or more, eventually contributing up to 7 m to global mean sea level rise.

The colour shading indicates the additional risk due to climate change when a temperature level is reached and then sustained or exceeded. White indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change. Yellow indicates that associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium conﬁdence. Red indicates severe and widespread impacts. Purple, introduced in this assessment, shows that very high risk is indicated by all key risk criteria. {WGII Assessment Box SPM.1, Figure 19-4} 2 Aggregate economic losses accelerate with increasing tempera- ture (limited evidence, high agreement), but global economic impacts from climate change are currently difﬁcult to estimate. With recognized limitations, the existing incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for warming of ~2.5°C above pre-industrial levels are 0.2 to 2.0% of income (medium evidence, medium agree- ment). Changes in population, age structure, income, technology, rela- tive prices, lifestyle, regulation and governance are projected to have relatively larger impacts than climate change, for most economic sec- tors (medium evidence, high agreement). More severe and/or frequent weather hazards are projected to increase disaster-related losses and loss variability, posing challenges for affordable insurance, particularly in developing countries. International dimensions such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks of climate change at regional scales. (Box 3.1) {WGII 3.5, 10.2, 10.7, 10.9–10.10, 17.4–17.5, 25.7, 26.7–26.9, Box 25-7} From a poverty perspective, climate change impacts are pro- jected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difﬁcult, further erode food security and prolong exist- ing poverty traps and create new ones, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger (medium conﬁ- dence). Climate change impacts are expected to exacerbate poverty in most developing countries and create new poverty pockets in countries with increasing inequality, in both developed and developing countries (Figure 2.4). {WGII 8.1, 8.3–8.4, 9.3, 10.9, 13.2–13.4, 22.3, 26.8} Climate change is projected to increase displacement of people (medium evidence, high agreement). Displacement risk increases when populations that lack the resources for planned migration expe- rience higher exposure to extreme weather events, such as ﬂoods and droughts. Expanding opportunities for mobility can reduce vulnerability for such populations. Changes in migration patterns can be responses to both extreme weather events and longer term climate variability and change, and migration can also be an effective adaptation strategy. {WGII 9.3, 12.4, 19.4, 22.3, 25.9} Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conﬂict by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conﬂicts, such as poverty and economic shocks (medium conﬁdence). Multiple lines of evidence relate climate variability to some forms of conﬂict. {WGII SPM, 12.5, 13.2, 19.4} 2.4 Climate change beyond 2100, irreversibility and abrupt changes Many aspects of climate change and its associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if anthropo- genic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures will remain approximately con- stant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions (see Section 2.2.5 for the relation- ship between CO2 emissions and global temperature change.). A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the 73 Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts conﬁdence), and the impact will be exacerbated by rising temperature extremes (Figure 2.5b). {WGI 3.8.2, 6.4.4, WGII SPM B-2, 6.3.2, 6.3.5, 30.5, Box CC-OA} Global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100 (virtually certain). The few available analyses that go beyond 2100 indicate sea level rise to be less than 1 m above the pre-industrial level by 2300 for GHG concentrations that peak and decline and remain below 500 ppm CO2-eq, as in scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing that corresponds to a CO2-eq concentration in 2100 that is above 700 ppm but below 1500 ppm, as in scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m by 2300 (medium conﬁdence) (Figure 2.8c). There is low conﬁdence in the available models’ ability to project solid ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet. Hence, these models likely underestimate the Antarctica ice sheet contribu- tion, resulting in an underestimation of projected sea level rise beyond 2100. {WGI SPM E.8, 13.4.4, 13.5.4} There is little evidence in global climate models of a tipping point or critical threshold in the transition from a perennially ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, beyond which further sea-ice loss is unstoppable and irreversible. {WGI 12.5.5} There is low conﬁdence in assessing the evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation beyond the 21st century because of the limited number of analyses and equivocal results. However, a collapse beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot be excluded. {WGI SPM E.4, 12.4.7, 12.5.5} Sustained mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise, and part of the mass loss might be irreversible. There is high conﬁdence that sustained global mean warming greater than a threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m. Current estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1°C (low conﬁdence) but less than about 4°C (medium conﬁdence) of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is pos- sible, but current evidence and understanding is insufﬁcient to make a quantitative assessment. {WGI SPM E.8, 5.6.2, 5.8.1, 13.4.3, 13.5.4} Within the 21st century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium to high emission scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) pose a high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wet- lands (medium conﬁdence), as well as warm water coral reefs (high conﬁdence). Examples that could substantially amplify climate change are the boreal-tundra Arctic system (medium conﬁdence) and the Amazon forest (low conﬁdence). {WGII 4.3.3.1, Box 4.3, Box 4.4, 5.4.2.4, 6.3.1–6.3.4, 6.4.2, 30.5.3–30.5.6, Box CC-CR, Box CC-MB} A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain with contin- ued rise in global temperatures. Current permafrost areas are pro- jected to become a net emitter of carbon (CO2 and CH4) with a loss of 180 to 920 GtCO2 (50 to 250 GtC) under RCP8.5 over the 21st century (low conﬁdence). {WGI TFE.5, 6.4.3.4, 12.5.5, WGII 4.3.3.4} Figure 2.8 | (a) Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and (b) projected global mean surface temperature change as simulated by Earth System Models of Intermediate Com- plexity (EMICs) for the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) up to 2300 (relative to 1986–2005) followed by a constant (year 2300 level) radiative forcing. A 10-year smoothing was applied. The dashed line on (a) indicates the pre-industrial CO2 concentration. (c) Sea level change projections grouped into three categories according to the concentration of greenhouse gas (in CO2-eq) in 2100 (low: concentrations that peak and decline and remain below 500 ppm, as in scenario RCP2.6; medium: 500 to 700 ppm, including RCP4.5; high: concentrations that are above 700 ppm but below 1500 ppm, as in scenario RCP6.0 and RCP8.5). The bars in (c) show the maximum pos- sible spread that can be obtained with the few available model results (and should not be interpreted as uncertainty ranges). These models likely underestimate the Antarctica ice sheet contribution, resulting in an underestimation of projected sea level rise beyond 2100. {WGI Figure 12.43, Figure 13.13, Table 13.8, WGII SPM B-2} case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sus- tained period (Figure 2.8a, b). {WGI SPM E.1, SPM E.8, 12.5.2} Stabilization of global average surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate system. Shifting biomes, re-equilibrating soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long times- cales that will result in ongoing changes for hundreds to thousands of years after global surface temperature has been stabilized. {WGI SPM E.8, 12.5.2–12.5.4, WGII 4.2} Ocean acidiﬁcation will continue for centuries if CO2 emissions continue, it will strongly affect marine ecosystems (high 74 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development 3 n o i t c u d o r t n I 75 Topic 3 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Topic 3: Future Pathways for Adaption, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks of climate change. Sub- stantial emissions reductions over the next few decades can reduce climate risks in the 21st century and beyond, increase prospects for effective adaptation, reduce the costs and challenges of mitigation in the longer term and contribute to climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development. Adaptation and mitigation are two complementary strategies for responding to climate change. Adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in order to either lessen or avoid harm or exploit beneﬁcial opportunities. Mitigation is the process of reducing emissions or enhancing sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs), so as to limit future climate change. Both adaptation and mitigation can reduce and manage the risks of climate change impacts. Yet adaptation and mitigation can also create other risks, as well as beneﬁts. Strategic responses to climate change involve consideration of climate-related risks along with the risks and co-beneﬁts of adaptation and mitigation actions. {WGII SPM A-3, SPM C, Glossary, WGIII SPM.2, 4.1, 5.1, Glossary} Mitigation, adaptation and climate impacts can all result in transformations to and changes in systems. Depending on the rate and magnitude of change and the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, climate change will alter ecosystems, food systems, infrastructure, coastal, urban and rural areas, human health and livelihoods. Adaptive responses to a changing climate require actions that range from incre- mental changes to more fundamental, transformational changes34.20Mitigation can involve fundamental changes in the way that human societies produce and use energy services and land. {WGII B, C, TS C, Box TS.8, Glossary, WGIII SPM.4} Topic 3 of this report examines the factors that inﬂuence the assessment of mitigation and adaptation strategies. It considers the beneﬁts, risks, incremental changes and potential transformations from different combinations of mitigation, adaptation and residual climate-related impacts. It considers how responses in the coming decades will inﬂuence options for limiting long-term climate change and opportunities for adapting to it. Finally, it considers factors—including uncertainty, ethical considerations and links to other societal goals—that may inﬂuence choices about mitigation and adaptation. Topic 4 then assesses the prospects for mitigation and adaptation on the basis of current knowledge of tools, options and policies. 3.1 Foundations of decision-making about climate change 3 Effective decision-making to limit climate change and its effects can be informed by a wide range of ana- lytical approaches for evaluating expected risks and beneﬁts, recognizing the importance of governance, ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments, economic assessments and diverse perceptions and responses to risk and uncertainty. Sustainable development and equity provide a basis for assess- ing climate policies. Limiting the effects of climate change is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity, including poverty eradication. Countries’ past and future contribu- tions to the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and countries also face varying challenges and circumstances and have dif- ferent capacities to address mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice and fairness and are necessary to achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication. Many of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed and contribute little to GHG emissions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens from the present to the future, and insufﬁcient adaptation responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Both adaptation and mitigation can have distributional effects locally, nationally and internationally, depending on who pays and who beneﬁts. The process of decision-making about climate change, and the degree to which it respects the rights and views of all those affected, is also a concern of justice. {WGII 2.2, 2.3, 13.3, 13.4, 17.3, 20.2, 20.5, WGIII SPM.2, 3.3, 3.10, 4.1.2, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8} Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently. Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, because most GHGs accumulate over time and mix globally, and emis- sions by any agent (e.g., individual, community, company, country) affect other agents. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emis- sions and address other climate change issues. The effectiveness of adaptation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, including international cooperation. The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooper- ation. {WGII 20.3.1, WGIII SPM.2, TS.1, 1.2, 2.6, 3.2, 4.2, 13.2, 13.3} Decision-making about climate change involves valuation and mediation among diverse values and may be aided by the ana- lytic methods of several normative disciplines. Ethics analyses the different values involved and the relations between them. Recent political philosophy has investigated the question of responsibility for the effects of emissions. Economics and decision analysis provide 34 Transformation is used in this report to refer to a change in the fundamental attributes of a system (see Glossary). Transformations can occur at multiple levels; at the national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reﬂects a country’s own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities. {WGII SPM C-2, 2–13, 20.5, WGIII SPM, 6–12} 76 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Topic 3 quantitative methods of valuation which can be used for estima- ting the social cost of carbon (see Box 3.1), in cost–beneﬁt and cost- effectiveness analyses, for optimization in integrated models and elsewhere. Economic methods can reﬂect ethical principles, and take account of non-marketed goods, equity, behavioural biases, ancil- lary beneﬁts and costs and the differing values of money to different people. They are, however, subject to well-documented limitations. {WGII 2.2, 2.3, WGIII SPM.2, Box TS.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.2–3.6, 3.9.4} Analytical methods of valuation cannot identify a single best balance between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts. Important reasons for this are that climate change involves extremely complex natural and social processes, there is extensive dis- agreement about the values concerned, and climate change impacts and mitigation approaches have important distributional effects. Nev- ertheless, information on the consequences of emissions pathways to alternative climate goals and risk levels can be a useful input into decision-making processes. Evaluating responses to climate change involves assessment of the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. {WGII 1.1.4, 2.3, 2.4, 17.3, 19.6, 19.7, WGIII 2.5, 2.6, 3.4, 3.7, Box 3-9} Effective decision-making and risk management in the complex environment of climate change may be iterative: strategies can often be adjusted as new information and understanding devel- ops during implementation. However, adaptation and mitigation choices in the near term will affect the risks of climate change through- out the 21st century and beyond, and prospects for climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development depend on what is achieved through mitigation. Opportunities to take advantage of positive syn- ergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if mitigation is delayed too long. Decision-making about climate change is inﬂuenced by how individuals and organizations per- ceive risks and uncertainties and take them into account. They some- times use simpliﬁed decision rules, overestimate or underestimate risks and are biased towards the status quo. They differ in their degree of risk aversion and the relative importance placed on near-term versus long-term ramiﬁcations of speciﬁc actions. Formalized analytical meth- ods for decision-making under uncertainty can account accurately for risk, and focus attention on both short- and long-term consequences. {WGII SPM A-3, SPM C-2, 2.1–2.4, 3.6, 14.1–14.3, 15.2–15.4, 17.1– 17.3, 17.5, 20.2, 20.3, 20.6, WGIII SPM.2, 2.4, 2.5, 5.5, 16.4} 3.2 Climate change risks reduced by adaptation and mitigation Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally (high conﬁdence). Mitigation involves some level of co-beneﬁts and of risks due to adverse side effects, but these risks do not involve the same pos- sibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change, increasing the beneﬁts from near-term mitigation efforts. The risks of climate change, adaptation and mitigation differ in nature, timescale, magnitude and persistence (high conﬁdence). Risks from adaptation include maladaptation and negative ancillary impacts. Risks from mitigation include possible adverse side effects of large-scale deployment of low-carbon technology options and eco- nomic costs. Climate change risks may persist for millennia and can involve very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of signiﬁcant irreversibilities combined with limited adaptive capacity. In contrast, the stringency of climate policies can be adjusted much more quickly in response to observed consequences and costs and create lower risks of irreversible consequences (3.3, 3.4, 4.3). {WGI SPM E.8, 12.4, 12.5.2, 13.5, WGII 4.2, 17.2, 19.6, WGIII TS.3.1.4, Table TS.4, Table TS.5, Table TS.6, Table TS.7, Table TS.8, 2.5, 6.6} n o i t c u d o r t n I 3 Mitigation and adaptation are complementary approaches for reducing risks of climate change impacts. They interact with one another and reduce risks over different timescales (high conﬁ- dence). Beneﬁts from adaptation can already be realized in addressing current risks and can be realized in the future for addressing emerging risks. Adaptation has the potential to reduce climate change impacts over the next few decades, while mitigation has relatively little inﬂu- ence on climate outcomes over this timescale. Near-term and longer- term mitigation and adaptation, as well as development pathways, will determine the risks of climate change beyond mid-century. The poten- tial for adaptation differs across sectors and will be limited by institu- tional and capacity constraints, increasing the long-term beneﬁts of mitigation (high conﬁdence). The level of mitigation will inﬂuence the rate and magnitude of climate change, and greater rates and magni- tude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits (high conﬁdence) (3.3). {WGI 11.3, 12.4, WGII SPM A-3, SPM B-2, SPM C-2, 1.1.4.4, 2.5, 16.3–16.6, 17.3, 19.2, 20.2.3, 20.3, 20.6} Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, wide- spread and irreversible impacts globally (high conﬁdence) (Topic 2 and Figure 3.1a). Estimates of warming in 2100 without additional climate mitigation efforts are from 3.7°C to 4.8°C compared with pre-industrial levels (median climate response); the range is 2.5°C to 7.8°C when using the 5th to 95th percentile range of the median climate response (Figure 3.1). The risks associated with temperatures at or above 4°C include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial species extinction, large risks to global and regional food security, consequential constraints on common human activities, increased likelihood of triggering tipping points (criti- cal thresholds) and limited potential for adaptation in some cases (high conﬁdence). Some risks of climate change, such as risks to unique and threatened systems and risks associated with extreme weather events, are moderate to high at temperatures 1°C to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. {WGII SPM B-1, SPM C-2, WGIII SPM.3} Substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades can substantially reduce risks of climate change by limiting warming in the second half of the 21st century and beyond (high conﬁdence). Global mean surface warming is largely deter- mined by cumulative emissions, which are, in turn, linked to emissions over different timescales (Figure 3.1). Limiting risks across Reasons For Concern would imply a limit for cumulative emissions of CO2. 77 78Such a limit would require that global net emissions of CO2 even-tually decrease to zero (Figure 3.1a,b) (high conﬁdence). Reducing risks of climate change through mitigation would involve substan-tial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades (Figure 3.1c). But some risks from residual damages are unavoidable, even with mitigation and adaptation (very high conﬁdence). A subset of relevant climate change risks has been estimated using aggregate economic indicators. Such economic estimates have important limitations and are therefore a useful but insufﬁcient basis for decision-making on long-term mitigation targets (see Box 3.1). {WGII 19.7.1, WGIII SPM.3, Figure 3.1}Mitigation involves some level of co-beneﬁts and risks, but these risks do not involve the same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change (high con-ﬁdence). Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C or even 3°C compared with pre-industrial temperatures involve large-scale changes in energy systems and potentially land use over the coming decades (3.4). Associated risks include those linked to large-scale deployment of technology options for producing low-carbon energy, the potential for high aggregate economic costs of mitigation and impacts on vulnerable countries and industries. Other risks and co-beneﬁts are associated with human health, food security, energy security, poverty Figure 3.1 | The relationship between risks from climate change, temperature change, cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and changes in annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Limiting risks across Reasons For Concern (a) would imply a limit for cumulative emissions of CO2 (b), which would constrain annual emissions over the next few decades (c). Panel a reproduces the ﬁve Reasons For Concern (Box 2.4). Panel b links temperature changes to cumulative CO2 emissions (in GtCO2), from 1870. They are based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations (pink plume) and on a simple climate model (median climate response in 2100) for the baselines and ﬁve mitigation scenario categories (six ellipses). Details are provided in Figure 2.3. Panel c shows the relationship between the cumulative CO2 emissions (in GtCO2) of the scenario categories and their associated change in annual GHG emissions by 2050, expressed in percentage change (in percent GtCO2-eq per year) relative to 2010. The ellipses correspond to the same scenario categories as in Panel b, and are built with a similar method (see details in Figure 2.3). Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Topic 3 reduction, biodiversity conservation, water availability, income distri- bution, efﬁciency of taxation systems, labour supply and employment, urban sprawl, fossil fuel export revenues and the economic growth of developing countries (Table 4.5). {WGIII SPM.4.1, SPM.4.2, TS.3.1.4, Table TS.4, Table TS.5, Table TS.6, Table TS.7, Table TS.8, 6.6} Inertia in the economic and climate systems and the possibil- ity of irreversible impacts from climate change increase the beneﬁts of near-term mitigation efforts (high conﬁdence). The actions taken today affect the options available in the future to reduce emissions, limit temperature change and adapt to climate change. Near-term choices can create, amplify or limit signiﬁcant elements of lock-in that are important for decision-making. Lock-ins and irrevers- ibilities occur in the climate system due to large inertia in some of its components such as heat transfer from the ocean surface to depth leading to continued ocean warming for centuries regardless of emis- sion scenario and the irreversibility of a large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions on a multi-century to mil- lennial timescale unless CO2 were to be removed from the atmosphere through large-scale human interventions over a sustained period (see also Box 3.3). Irreversibilities in socio-economic and biological systems also result from infrastructure development and long-lived products and from climate change impacts, such as species extinction. The larger potential for irreversibility and pervasive impacts from climate change risks than from mitigation risks increases the beneﬁt of short- term mitigation efforts. Delays in additional mitigation or constraints on technological options limit the mitigation options and increase the long-term mitigation costs as well as other risks that would be incurred in the medium to long term to hold climate change impacts at a given level (Table WGIII SPM.2, blue segment). {WGI SPM E-8, WGII SPM B-2, 2.1, 19.7, 20.3, Box 20-4, WGIII SPM.4.1, SPM.4.2.1, 3.6, 6.4, 6.6, 6.9} 3.3 Characteristics of adaptation pathways Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, espe- cially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer-term perspective, in the con- text of sustainable development, increases the likeli- hood that more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of current and future populations, the security of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-speciﬁc, with no single approach for reducing risks appropriate across all settings (high conﬁdence). Effective risk reduction and adaptation strategies con- sider vulnerability and exposure and their linkages with socio-economic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation research since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) has evolved from a dominant consideration of engineering and technological adap- tation pathways to include more ecosystem-based, institutional and social measures. A previous focus on cost–beneﬁt analysis, optimiza- tion and efﬁciency approaches has broadened with the development of multi-metric evaluations that include risk and uncertainty dimensions integrated within wider policy and ethical frameworks to assess trade- offs and constraints. The range of speciﬁc adaptation measures has also expanded (4.2, 4.4.2.1), as have the links to sustainable devel- opment (3.5). There are many studies on local and sectoral adaptation costs and beneﬁts, but few global analyses and very low conﬁdence n o i t c u d o r t n I 3 Box 3.1 | The Limits of the Economic Assessment of Climate Change Risks A subset of climate change risks and impacts are often measured using aggregate economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (GDP) or aggregate income. Estimates, however, are partial and affected by important conceptual and empirical limitations. These incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for temperature increases of ~2.5°C above pre-industrial levels are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income (medium evidence, medium agreement). Losses are more likely than not to be greater, rather than smaller, than this range (limited evidence, high agreement). Estimates of the incremental aggregate economic impact of emitting one more tonne of carbon dioxide (the social cost of carbon) are derived from these studies and lie between a few dollars and several hundreds of dollars per tonne of carbon in 2000 to 2015 (robust evidence, medium agreement). These impact esti- mates are incomplete and depend on a large number of assumptions, many of which are disputable. Many estimates do not account for the possibility of large-scale singular events and irreversibility, tipping points and other important factors, especially those that are difﬁcult to monetize, such as loss of biodiversity. Estimates of aggregate costs mask signiﬁcant differences in impacts across sectors, regions, countries and communities, and they therefore depend on ethical considerations, especially on the aggregation of losses across and within countries (high conﬁdence). Estimates of global aggregate economic losses exist only for limited warming levels. These levels are exceeded in scenarios for the 21st century unless additional mitigation action is implemented, leading to additional economic costs. The total economic effects at different temperature levels would include mitigation costs, co-beneﬁts of mitigation, adverse side effects of mitigation, adaptation costs and climate damages. As a result, mitigation cost and climate damage estimates at any given temperature level cannot be compared to evaluate the costs and beneﬁts of mitigation. Very little is known about the economic cost of warming above 3°C relative to the current temperature level. Accurately estimating climate change risks (and thus the beneﬁts of mitigation) takes into account the full range of possible impacts of climate change, including those with high consequences but a low probability of occurrence. The beneﬁts of mitigation may otherwise be underestimated (high conﬁdence). Some limitations of current estimates may be unavoidable, even with more knowledge, such as issues with aggregating impacts over time and across individuals when values are heterogeneous. In view of these limitations, it is outside the scope of science to identify a single best climate change target and climate policy (3.1, 3.4). {WGII SPM B-2, 10.9.2, 10.9.4, 13.2, 17.2–17.3, 18.4, 19.6, WGIII 3.6} 79 Topic 3 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development in their results. {WGII SPM C-1, Table SPM.1, 14.1, 14.ES, 15.2, 15.5, 17.2, 17.ES} Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of gov- ernance are contingent on societal values, objectives and risk perceptions (high conﬁdence). Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can beneﬁt decision-making processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowl- edge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapt- ing to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge into practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation as do effec- tive decision support, engagement and policy processes (4.4.2). {WGII SPM C-1} Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, from individu- als to governments (high conﬁdence). National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversiﬁcation and by providing information, policy and legal frame- works and ﬁnancial support (robust evidence, high agreement). Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as crit- ical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adapta- tion of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and ﬁnancing (medium evidence, high agreement). {WGII SPM C-1} 3 A ﬁrst step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variabil- ity (high conﬁdence), but some near-term responses to climate change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation into planning, including policy design, and decision-making can pro- mote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction. How- ever, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term outcomes or failing to sufﬁciently anticipate consequences can result in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sec- tors (medium evidence, high agreement). For example, enhanced pro- tection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by including co-beneﬁts and mitigation implications (3.5 and 4.2). {WGII SPM C-1} Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation plan- ning and implementation (high conﬁdence). Common constraints on implementation arise from the following: limited ﬁnancial and human resources; limited integration or coordination of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other con- straints include insufﬁcient research, monitoring and observation and the ﬁnancial and other resources to maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealis- tic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes (see Sections 4.1 and 4.2 for details in relation to implementation). {WGII SPM C-1} 80 Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits (high conﬁdence). Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolera- ble risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of the world, insufﬁcient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors, empirical evidence is not sufﬁcient to quantify magnitudes of climate change that would constitute a future adaptation limit. Furthermore, economic development, technology and cultural norms and values can change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems to avoid limits. As a consequence, some limits are ‘soft’ in that they may be alle- viated over time. Other limits are ‘hard’ in that there are no reasonable prospects for avoiding intolerable risks. {WGII SPM C-2, TS} Transformations in economic, social, technological and political decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote sus- tainable development (high conﬁdence). Restricting adaptation responses to incremental changes to existing systems and structures without considering transformational change may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities. For example, enhancing infrastructure to protect other built assets can be expensive and ultimately not defray increasing costs and risks, whereas options such as relocation or using ecosystem services to adapt may provide a range of beneﬁts now and in the future. Transformational adaptation can include introduction of new technologies or practices, formation of new ﬁnancial structures or systems of governance, adaptation at greater scales or magnitudes and shifts in the location of activities. Planning and implementation of transformational adaptation could reﬂect strengthened, altered or aligned paradigms and consequently may place new and increased demands on governance structures to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address possible equity and ethical impli- cations: transformational adaptation pathways are enhanced by iter- ative learning, deliberative processes, and innovation. At the national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reﬂects a country’s own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable devel- opment in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities. {WGII SPM C-2, 1.1, 2.5, 5.5, 8.4, 14.1, 14.3, 16.2-7, 20.3.3, 20.5, 25.10, Table 14-4, Table 16-3, Box 16.1, Box 16.4, Box 25.1} Building adaptive capacity is crucial for effective selection and implementation of adaptation options (robust evidence, high agreement). Successful adaptation requires not only identi- fying adaptation options and assessing their costs and beneﬁts, but also increasing the adaptive capacity of human and natural systems (medium evidence, high agreement). This can involve complex govern- ance challenges and new institutions and institutional arrangements. (4.2) {WGII 8.1, 12.3, 14.1-3, 16.2, 16.3, 16.5, 16.8} Signiﬁcant co-beneﬁts, synergies and trade-offs exist between mitigation and adaptation and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions (very high conﬁdence). Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Topic 3 change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections among water, energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of actions with co-beneﬁts include (i) improved energy efﬁciency and cleaner energy sources, leading to reduced emissions of health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants; (ii) reduced energy and water consump- tion in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; (iii) sustainable agriculture and forestry; and (iv) protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services. {WGII SPM C-1} 3.4 Characteristics of mitigation pathways Many different combinations of technological, behavioural and policy options can be used to reduce emissions and limit tem- perature change (high conﬁdence). To evaluate possible pathways to long-term climate goals, about 900 mitigation scenarios were col- lected for this assessment, each of which describes different techno- logical, socio-economic and institutional changes. Emission reductions under these scenarios lead to concentrations in 2100 from 430 ppm CO2-eq to above 720 ppm CO2-eq which is comparable to the 2100 forcing levels between RCP2.6 and RCP6.0. Scenarios with concen- tration levels of below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 were also assessed. {WGIII SPM.4.1, TS3.1, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, Annex II} n o i t c u d o r t n I There are multiple mitigation pathways that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. These pathways would require substantial emis- sions reductions over the next few decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by the end of the century. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological, economic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional mitigation and if key tech- nologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales. Scenarios leading to CO2-eq concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels (high conﬁdence). Miti- gation scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100. In this case, warming is about as likely as not to remain below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. Scenarios that exceed about 650 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation scenarios in which warming is more likely than not to be less than 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels by 2100 are characterized by concentration levels by 2100 of below 430 ppm CO2-eq. In these scenarios, temperature peaks during the century and subsequently declines (Table 3.1). {WGIII SPM.4.1, Table SPM.1, TS.3.1, Box TS.6, 6.3} Without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global emission growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and economic activities (high conﬁdence) (Figure 3.2). Global GHG emissions under most scenarios without additional mitigation (baseline scenar- ios) are between about 75 GtCO2-eq/yr and almost 140 GtCO2-eq/yr in 21003520which is approximately between the 2100 emission levels in the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 pathways (Figure 3.2)3621. Baseline scenarios exceed 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2030 and reach CO2-eq concentration levels between about 750 ppm CO2-eq and more than 1300 ppm CO2-eq by 2100. Global mean surface temperature increases in 2100 range from about 3.7°C to 4.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response. They range from 2.5°C to 7.8°C when including cli- mate uncertainty (5th to 95th percentile range)3722. The future scenarios do not account for possible changes in natural forcings in the cli- mate system (see Box 1.1). {WGIII SPM.3, SPM.4.1, TS.2.2, TS.3.1, 6.3, Box TS.6} 3 Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 (consistent with a likely chance to keep warming below 2°C rel- ative to pre-industrial level) typically involve temporary over- shoot3823 of atmospheric concentrations, as do many scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 (Table 3.1). Depending on the level of overshoot, over- shoot scenarios typically rely on the availability and wide- spread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation in the second half of the century (high conﬁdence). The availability and scale of these and other Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies and methods are uncertain, and CDR technologies and methods are, to varying degrees, associated with challenges and risks (see Box 3.3)3924. CDR is also prev- alent in many scenarios without overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is more expensive. {WGIII SPM.4.1, Table SPM.1, TS.3.1, 6.3, 6.9.1, Figure 6.7, 7.11, 11.13} 35 Unless otherwise noted, scenario ranges cited in Topic 3 and Topic 4 refer to the 10th to 90th percentile ranges (see Table 3.1). 36 For a discussion on CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions and concentrations, see Box 3.2 on GHG metrics and mitigation pathways and the Glossary. 37 The range quoted here is based on the warming results of a simple climate model for the emissions of around 300 baseline scenarios, expressed compared to the 1850–1900 period. The warming results quoted in Section 2.2 are obtained by prescribing future concentrations of GHG in CMIP5 Earth System Models. This results in a mean warming of 1.0°C (5th to 95th percentile range: 0.3°C to 1.7°C) for RCP2.6, and a mean warming of 3.7°C (2.6°C to 4.8°C) for RCP8.5 relative to the period 1986–2005. For the same concentration-driven experiments, the simple climate model approach gives consistent results. The median warming is 0.9°C (0.5°C to 1.6°C) for RCP2.6 and 3.7°C (2.5°C to 5.9°C) for RCP8.5 relative to the period 1986–2005. However, the high-end of the CMIP5 ESMs range is more constrained. In addition, the baseline temperature increase quoted here is wider than that of the concentration-driven RCP8.5 experiments mentioned above as it is based on a wider set of scenarios, includes carbon cycle response uncertainty, and uses a different base year (2.2, 3.4). 38 In concentration ‘overshoot’ scenarios, concentrations peak during the century and then decline. 39 CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on the global scale. There is insufﬁcient knowledge to quantify how much CO2 emissions could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. CDR methods may carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale. 81 Figure 3.2 | Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr) in baseline and mitigation scenarios for different long-term concentration levels (a) and associated scale-up requirements of low-carbon energy (% of primary energy) for 2030, 2050 and 2100, compared to 2010 levels, in mitigation scenarios (b). {WGIII SPM.4, Figure 6.7, Figure 7.16} [Note: CO2-eq emissions include the basket of Kyoto gases (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) as well as ﬂuorinated gases) calculated based on 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report.] Limiting warming with a likely chance to less than 2°C rela- tive to pre-industrial levels would require substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions4025 by mid-century through large- scale changes in energy systems and possibly land use. Limit- ing warming to higher levels would require similar changes but less quickly. Limiting warming to lower levels would require these changes more quickly (high conﬁdence). Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C are characterized by a 40 to 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels, and emissions levels near zero or below in 2100 (Figure 3.2, Table 3.1). Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are characterized by a greater reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century, and vice versa. Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C include more rapid improvements in energy efﬁciency and a tripling to nearly a quadrupling of the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply from renewable energy, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) or BECCS by the year 2050 (Figure 3.2b). The scenarios describe a wide range of changes in land use, reﬂecting 40 This range differs from the range provided for a similar concentration category in AR4 (50 to 85% lower than in 2000 for CO2 only). Reasons for this difference include that this report has assessed a substantially larger number of scenarios than in AR4 and looks at all GHGs. In addition, a large proportion of the new scenarios include CDR technologies. Other factors include the use of 2100 concentration levels instead of stabilization levels and the shift in reference year from 2000 to 2010. Scenarios with higher emission levels by 2050 are characterized by a greater reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century. 82 otes: a The ‘total range’ for the 430 to 480 ppm CO2-eq concentrations scenarios corresponds to the range of the 10th to 90th percentile of the subcategory of these scenarios shown in Table 6.3 of the Working Group III report. b Baseline scenarios fall into the >1000 and 720 to 1000 ppm CO2-eq categories. The latter category also includes mitigation scenarios. The baseline scenarios in the latter category reach a temperature change of 2.5°C to 5.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 in 2100. Together with the baseline scenarios in the >1000 ppm CO2-eq category, this leads to an overall 2100 temperature range of 2.5°C to 7.8°C (range based on median climate response: 3.7°C to 4.8°C) for baseline scenarios across both concentration categories. c The global 2010 emissions are 31% above the 1990 emissions (consistent with the historic greenhouse gas emission estimates presented in this report). CO2-eq emissions include the basket of Kyoto gases (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) as well as ﬂuorinated gases). d The assessment here involves a large number of scenarios published in the scientiﬁc literature and is thus not limited to the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). To evaluate the CO2-eq concentration and climate implications of these scenarios, the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) was used in a probabilistic mode. For a comparison between MAGICC model results and the outcomes of the models used in WGI, see WGI 12.4.1.2, 12.4.8 and WGIII 6.3.2.6. 3 e The assessment in this table is based on the probabilities calculated for the full ensemble of scenarios in WGIII using MAGICC and the assessment in WGI of the uncertainty of the temperature projections not covered by climate models. The statements are therefore consistent with the statements in WGI, which are based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) runs of the RCPs and the assessed uncertainties. Hence, the likelihood statements reﬂect different lines of evidence from both WGs. This WGI method was also applied for scenarios with intermediate concentration levels where no CMIP5 runs are available. The likelihood statements are indicative only {WGIII 6.3} and follow broadly the terms used by the WGI SPM for temperature projections: likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, and unlikely 0–33%. In addition the term more unlikely than likely 0–<50% is used. f The CO2-equivalent concentration (see Glossary) is calculated on the basis of the total forcing from a simple carbon cycle/climate model, MAGICC. The CO2-equivalent concentra- tion in 2011 is estimated to be 430 ppm (uncertainty range 340 to 520 ppm). This is based on the assessment of total anthropogenic radiative forcing for 2011 relative to 1750 in WGI, i.e., 2.3 W/m2, uncertainty range 1.1 to 3.3 W/m2. g The vast majority of scenarios in this category overshoot the category boundary of 480 ppm CO2-eq concentration. h For scenarios in this category, no CMIP5 run or MAGICC realization stays below the respective temperature level. Still, an unlikely assignment is given to reﬂect uncertainties that may not be reﬂected by the current climate models. i Scenarios in the 580 to 650 ppm CO2-eq category include both overshoot scenarios and scenarios that do not exceed the concentration level at the high end of the category (e.g., RCP4.5). The latter type of scenarios, in general, have an assessed probability of more unlikely than likely to stay below the 2°C temperature level, while the former are mostly assessed to have an unlikely probability of staying below this level. j In these scenarios, global CO2-eq emissions in 2050 are between 70 to 95% below 2010 emissions, and they are between 110 to 120% below 2010 emissions in 2100. different assumptions about the scale of bioenergy production, affores- tation and reduced deforestation. Scenarios leading to concentra- tions of 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are characterized by a 25 to 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels. Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to 3°C relative to pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming to 2°C. Only a limited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are characterized by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emis- sion reduction between 70 and 95% below 2010. For a comprehen- sive overview of the characteristics of emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and their likelihood to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Table 3.1. {WGIII SPM.4.1, TS.3.1, 6.3, 7.11} 83 3 Figure 3.3 | The implications of different 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels for the rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions and low-carbon energy upscaling in mitigation scenarios that are at least about as likely as not to keep warming throughout the 21st century below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels (2100 CO2-eq concentrations 430 to 530 ppm). The scenarios are grouped according to different emissions levels by 2030 (coloured in different shades of green). The left panel shows the pathways of GHG emissions (GtCO2-eq/yr) leading to these 2030 levels. Black dot with whiskers gives historic GHG emission levels and associated uncertainties in 2010 as reported in Figure 1.6. The black bar shows the estimated uncertainty range of GHG emissions implied by the Cancún Pledges. The middle panel denotes the average annual CO2 emission reduction rates for the 2030–2050 period. It compares the median and interquartile range across scenarios from recent intermodel comparisons with explicit 2030 interim goals to the range of scenarios in the Scenario Database for WGIII AR5. Annual rates of historical emission changes (sustained over a period of 20 years) are shown as well. The arrows in the right panel show the magnitude of zero and low-carbon energy supply upscaling from between 2030 and 2050, subject to different 2030 GHG emission levels. Zero- and low-carbon energy supply includes renewable energy, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) or bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Only scenarios that apply the full, unconstrained mitigation technology portfolio of the underlying models (default technology assumption) are shown. Scenarios with large net negative global emissions (>20 GtCO2-eq/yr), scenarios with exogenous carbon price assumptions, and scenarios with 2010 emission levels that are signiﬁcantly outside the historical range are excluded. {WGIII Figure SPM.5, Figure 6.32, Figure 7.16, 13.13.1.3} Reducing emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can be an important element of mitigation strategies. Emissions of non- CO2 gases (methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ﬂuorinated gases) contributed about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010. For most non-CO2 gases, near-term, low-cost options are available to reduce their emissions. However, some sources of these non-CO2 gases are difﬁcult to mitigate, such as N2O emissions from fertilizer use and CH4 emissions from livestock. As a result, emissions of most non-CO2 gases will not be reduced to zero, even under stringent mitigation scenarios (see Figure 4.1). The differences in radiative properties and lifetimes of CO2 and non-CO2 climate forcing agents have important implications for mitigation strategies (see also Box 3.2). {WGIII 6.3.2} All current GHG emissions and other climate forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude of climate change over the next few decades. Reducing the emissions of certain short-lived climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents. Although the effects of CH4 emissions are well understood, there are large uncertainties related to the effects of black carbon. Co-emitted components with cooling effects may further complicate and reduce the climate impacts of emission reductions. Reducing emis- sions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) would cause warming. Near-term reduc- tions in short-lived climate forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible co-beneﬁts for air pollution. {WGI 8.2.3, 8.3.2, 8.3.4, 8.5.1, 8.7.2, FAQ 8.2, 12.5, WGIII 6.6.2.1} Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels (high conﬁdence). GHG emissions in 2030 lie between about 30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are likely to about as likely as not to limit warming to less than 2°C this cen- tury relative to pre-industrial levels (2100 atmospheric concentration 84 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Topic 3 Figure 3.4 | Global mitigation costs in cost-effective scenarios at different atmospheric concentrations levels in 2100 (right panel) and growth in economic consumption in the corresponding baseline scenarios (those without additional mitigation) (left panel). The table at the top shows percentage points of annualized consumption growth reductions relative to consumption growth in the baseline of 1.6 to 3% per year (e.g., if the reduction is 0.06 percentage points per year due to mitigation, and baseline growth is 2.0% per year, then the growth rate with mitigation would be 1.94% per year). Cost-effective scenarios assume immediate mitigation in all countries and a single global carbon price, and they impose no additional limitations on technology relative to the models’ default technology assumptions. Consumption losses are shown relative to a baseline development without climate policy. Cost estimates shown in this table do not consider the beneﬁts of reduced climate change nor co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects of mitigation. Estimates at the high end of these cost ranges are from models that are relatively inﬂexible to achieve the deep emissions reductions that would be required in the long run to meet these goals and/or include assumptions about market imperfections that would raise costs. {WGIII Table SPM.2, Figure TS.12, 6.3.6, Figure 6.21} 3 levels of about 450 ppm CO2-eq to about 500 ppm CO2-eq) (Figure 3.3, left panel). Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050 (median estimate of 6%/yr as compared to 3%/yr in cost-effective scenarios; Figure 3.3, middle panel); much more rapid scale-up of zero and low-carbon energy over this period (more than a tripling compared to a doubling of the low-carbon energy share rela- tive to 2010; Figure 3.3, right panel); a larger reliance on CDR tech- nologies in the long term; and higher transitional and long-term economic impacts (Table 3.2). (3.5, 4.3) {WGIII SPM.4.1, TS.3.1, 6.4, 7.11} Estimated global emission levels by 2020 based on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective long-term mitiga- tion trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels (2100 concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq or below), but they do not preclude the option to meet this goal (high conﬁ- dence). The Cancún Pledges are broadly consistent with cost-effective scenarios that are likely to limit temperature change to below 3°C rel- ative to pre-industrial levels. {WGIII SPM.4.1, 6.4, 13.13, Figure TS.11} Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions but increase with the stringency of mitigation (high conﬁdence). Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately, in which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all key tech- nologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs (Figure 3.4). Under these assumptions, mitigation scenarios that are likely to limit warm- ing to below 2°C through the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption—not including beneﬁts of reduced climate change (3.2) as well as co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects of mitigation (3.5, 4.3)—of 1 to 4% (median: 1.7%) in 2030, 2 to 6% (median: 3.4%) in 2050, and 3% to 11% (median: 4.8%) in 2100, relative to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows any- where from 300% to more than 900% over the century4126. These num- bers correspond to an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 (median: 0.06) percentage points over the century relative to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6% and 3% per year (Figure 3.4). In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies (such as bioenergy, CCS, and their combination BECCS, nuclear, wind and solar), mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered (Table 3.2). Delaying additional mitigation reduces near-term costs but increases mitigation costs in the medium- to long-term (Table 3.2). Many models could not limit likely warming to below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels, if additional mitigation is considerably delayed, or if availability of key technologies, such as bio- energy, CCS and their combination (BECCS) are limited (high conﬁdence) (Table 3.2). {WGIII SPM.4.1, Table SPM.2, Table TS.2, TS.3.1, 6.3, 6.6} 41 Mitigation cost ranges cited here refer to the 16th to 84th percentile of the underlying sample (see Figure 3.4). 85 Topic 3 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Mitigation efforts and associated cost are expected to vary across countries. The distribution of costs can differ from the distribution of the actions themselves (high conﬁdence). In glob- ally cost-effective scenarios, the majority of mitigation efforts takes place in countries with the highest future GHG emissions in baseline scenarios. Some studies exploring particular effort-sharing frameworks, under the assumption of a global carbon market, have estimated sub- stantial global ﬁnancial ﬂows associated with mitigation in scenarios that are likely to more unlikely than likely to limit warming during the 21st century to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. {WGIII SPM.4.1, TS.3.1, Box 3.5, 4.6, 6.3.6, Table 6.4, Figure 6.9, Figure 6.27, Figure 6.28, Figure 6.29, 13.4.2.4} Table 3.2 | Increase in global mitigation costs due to either limited availability of speciﬁc technologies or delays in additional mitigation a relative to cost-effective scenarios b. The increase in costs is given for the median estimate and the 16th to 84th percentile range of the scenarios (in parentheses). The sample size of each scenario set is provided in the coloured symbols c. The colours of the symbols indicate the fraction of models from systematic model comparison exercises that could successfully reach the targeted concentration level. {WGIII Table SPM.2,Table TS.2, Figure TS.13, Figure 6.24, Figure 6.25} Notes: a Delayed mitigation scenarios are associated with greenhouse gas emission of more than 55 GtCO2-eq in 2030, and the increase in mitigation costs is measured relative to cost- effective mitigation scenarios for the same long-term concentration level. b Cost-effective scenarios assume immediate mitigation in all countries and a single global carbon price, and impose no additional limitations on technology relative to the models’ default technology assumptions. c The range is determined by the central scenarios encompassing the 16th to 84th percentile range of the scenario set. Only scenarios with a time horizon until 2100 are included. Some models that are included in the cost ranges for concentration levels above 530 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 could not produce associated scenarios for concentration levels below 530 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 with assumptions about limited availability of technologies and/or delayed additional mitigation. d No CCS: carbon dioxide capture and storage is not included in these scenarios. Nuclear phase out: no addition of nuclear power plants beyond those under construction, and operation of existing plants until the end of their lifetime. Limited Solar/Wind: a maximum of 20% global electricity generation from solar and wind power in any year of these scenarios. Limited Bioenergy: a maximum of 100 EJ/yr modern bioenergy supply globally (modern bioenergy used for heat, power, combinations and industry was around 18 EJ/yr in 2008). EJ = Exajoule = 1018 Joule. e Percentage increase of net present value of consumption losses in percent of baseline consumption (for scenarios from general equilibrium models) and abatement costs in percent of baseline gross domestic product (GDP, for scenarios from partial equilibrium models) for the period 2015–2100, discounted at 5% per year. 86 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Topic 3 Box 3.2 | Greenhouse Gas Metrics and Mitigation Pathways This box focuses on emission-based metrics that are used for calculating CO2-equivalent emissions for the formulation and evaluation of mitigation strategies. These emission metrics are distinct from the concentration-based metric used in SYR (CO2-equivalent concen- tration). For an explanation of CO2-equivalent emissions and CO2-equivalent concentrations, see Glossary. Emission metrics facilitate multi-component climate policies by allowing emissions of different greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other climate forcing agents to be expressed in a common unit (so-called ‘CO2-equivalent emissions’). The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was introduced in the IPCC First Assessment Report, where it was also used to illustrate the difﬁculties in comparing components with differing physical properties using a single metric. The 100-year GWP (GWP100) was adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol and is now used widely as the default metric. It is only one of several possible emission metrics and time horizons. {WGI 8.7, WGIII 3.9} The choice of emission metric and time horizon depends on type of application and policy context; hence, no single metric is optimal for all policy goals. All metrics have shortcomings, and choices contain value judgments, such as the climate effect con- sidered and the weighting of effects over time (which explicitly or implicitly discounts impacts over time), the climate policy goal and the degree to which metrics incorporate economic or only physical considerations. There are signiﬁcant uncertainties related to metrics, and the magnitudes of the uncertainties differ across metric type and time horizon. In general, the uncertainty increases for metrics along the cause–effect chain from emission to effects. {WGI 8.7, WGIII 3.9} The weight assigned to non-CO2 climate forcing agents relative to CO2 depends strongly on the choice of metric and time horizon (robust evidence, high agreement). GWP compares components based on radiative forcing, integrated up to a chosen time horizon. Global Temperature change Potential (GTP; see Glossary) is based on the temperature response at a speciﬁc point in time with no weight on temperature response before or after the chosen point in time. Adoption of a ﬁxed horizon of, for example, 20, 100 or 500 years for these metrics will inevitably put no weight on climate outcomes beyond the time horizon, which is signiﬁcant for CO2 as well as other long-lived gases. The choice of time horizon markedly affects the weighting especially of short-lived climate forcing agents, such as methane (CH4) (see Box 3.2, Table 1; Box 3.2, Figure 1a). For some metrics (e.g., the dynamic GTP; see Glossary), the weighting changes over time as a chosen target year is approached. {WGI 8.7, WGIII 3.9} Notes: a Global Warming Potential (GWP) values have been updated in successive IPCC reports; the AR5 GWP100 values are different from those adopted for the Kyoto Protocol’s First Commitment Period which are from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). Note that for consistency, equivalent CO2 emissions given elsewhere in this Synthesis Report are also based on SAR, not AR5 values. For a comparison of emissions using SAR and AR5 GWP100 values for 2010 emissions, see Figure 1.6. b No single lifetime can be given for CO2. {WGI Box 6.1, 6.1.1, 8.7} The choice of emission metric affects the timing and emphasis placed on abating short- and long-lived climate forcing agents. For most metrics, global cost differences are small under scenarios of global participation and cost-minimizing mitigation pathways, but implications for some individual countries and sectors could be more signiﬁcant (medium evi- dence, high agreement). Different metrics and time horizons signiﬁcantly affect the contributions from various sources/sectors and components, particularly short-lived climate forcing agents (Box 3.2, Figure 1b). A ﬁxed time independent metric that gives less weight to short-lived agents such as CH4 (e.g., using GTP100 instead of GWP100) would require earlier and more stringent CO2 abatement to achieve the same climate outcome for 2100. Using a time-dependent metric, such as a dynamic GTP, leads to less CH4 mitigation n o i t c u d o r t n I 3 87 Topic 3 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Box 3.2 (continued) in the near term but to more in the long term as the target date is being approached. This implies that for some (short-lived) agents, the metric choice inﬂuences the choice of policies and the timing of mitigation (especially for sectors and countries with high non-CO2 emission levels). {WGI 8.7, WGIII 6.3} Box 3.2, Figure 1 | Implications of metric choices on the weighting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributions by sectors for illustrative time horizons. Panel (a): integrated radiative forcing (left panel) and warming resulting at a given future point in time (right panel) from global net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the year 2010 (and no emissions thereafter), for time horizons of up to 200 years. Integrated radiative forcing is used in the calculation of Global Warming Potentials (GWP), while the warming at a future point in time is used in the calculation of Global Temperature change Potentials (GTP). Radiative forcing and warming were calculated based on global 2010 emission data from WGIII 5.2 and absolute GWPs and absolute GTPs from WGI 8.7, normalized to the integrated radiative forcing and warming, respectively, after 100 years, due to 2010 net CO2 emissions.

See WGIII for details of activities resulting in emissions in each sector. 3 88 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Topic 3 Box 3.3 | Carbon Dioxide Removal and Solar Radiation Management Geoengineering Technologies— Possible Roles, Options, Risks and Status Geoengineering refers to a broad set of methods and technologies operating on a large scale that aim to deliberately alter the climate system in order to alleviate the impacts of climate change. Most methods seek to either reduce the amount of absorbed solar energy in the climate system (Solar Radiation Management, SRM) or increase the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by sinks to alter climate (Carbon Dioxide Removal, CDR, see Glossary). Limited evidence precludes a comprehensive assessment of feasi- bility, cost, side effects and environmental impacts of either CDR or SRM. {WGI SPM E.8, 6.5, 7.7, WGII 6.4, Table 6-5, Box 20-4, WGIII TS.3.1.3, 6.9} n o i t c u d o r t n I CDR plays a major role in many mitigation scenarios. Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS) and afforesta- tion are the only CDR methods included in these scenarios. CDR technologies are particularly important in scenarios that temporarily overshoot atmospheric concentrations, but they are also prevalent in many scenarios without overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is more expensive. Similar to mitigation, CDR would need to be deployed on a large scale and over a long time period to be able to signiﬁcantly reduce CO2 concentrations (see Section 3.1). {WGII 6.4, WGIII SPM 4.1, TS.3.1.2, TS 3.1.3, 6.3, 6.9} Several CDR techniques could potentially reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) levels. However, there are biogeo- chemical, technical and societal limitations that, to varying degrees, make it difﬁcult to provide quantitative estimates of the potential for CDR. The emission mitigation from CDR is less than the removed CO2, as some CO2 is released from that previ- ously stored in oceans and terrestrial carbon reservoirs. Sub-sea geologic storage has been implemented on a regional scale, with no evidence to date of ocean impact from leakage. The climatic and environmental side effects of CDR depend on technology and scale. Examples are associated with altered surface reﬂectance from afforestation and ocean de-oxygenation from ocean fertilization. Most terrestrial CDR techniques would involve competing demands for land and could involve local and regional risks, while maritime CDR techniques may involve signiﬁcant risks for ocean ecosystems, so that their deployment could pose additional challenges for coopera- tion between countries. {WGI 6.5, FAQ 7.3, WGII 6.4, Table 6.5, WGIII 6.9} SRM is untested, and is not included in any of the mitigation scenarios, but, if realisable, could to some degree offset global temperature rise and some of its effects. It could possibly provide rapid cooling in comparison to CO2 mitigation. There is medium conﬁdence that SRM through stratospheric aerosol injection is scalable to counter radiative forcing from a twofold increase in CO2 concentrations and some of the climate responses associated with warming. Due to insufﬁcient understanding there is no consensus on whether a similarly large negative counter radiative forcing could be achieved from cloud brightening. Land albedo change does not appear to be able to produce a large counter radiative forcing. Even if SRM could counter the global mean warming, differences in spatial patterns would remain. The scarcity of literature on other SRM techniques precludes their assessment. {WGI 7.7, WGIII TS.3.1.3, 6.9} 3 If it were deployed, SRM would entail numerous uncertainties, side effects, risks and shortcomings. Several lines of evidence indicate that SRM would itself produce a small but signiﬁcant decrease in global precipitation (with larger differences on regional scales). Stratospheric aerosol SRM is likely to modestly increase ozone losses in the polar stratosphere. SRM would not prevent the CO2 effects on ecosystems and ocean acidiﬁcation that are unrelated to warming. There could also be other unanticipated consequences. For all future scenarios considered in AR5, SRM would need to increase commensurately, to counter the global mean warming, which would exacerbate side effects. Additionally, if SRM were increased to substantial levels and then terminated, there is high conﬁdence that surface temperatures would rise very rapidly (within a decade or two). This would stress systems that are sensitive to the rate of warming. {WGI 7.6–7.7, FAQ 7.3, WGII 19.5, WGIII 6.9} SRM technologies raise questions about costs, risks, governance and ethical implications of development and deploy- ment. There are special challenges emerging for international institutions and mechanisms that could coordinate research and possibly restrain testing and deployment. Even if SRM would reduce human-made global temperature increase, it would imply spatial and temporal redistributions of risks. SRM thus introduces important questions of intragenerational and intergenerational justice. Research on SRM, as well as its eventual deployment, has been subject to ethical objections. In spite of the estimated low potential costs of some SRM deployment technologies, they will not necessarily pass a beneﬁt–cost test that takes account of the range of risks and side effects. The governance implications of SRM are particularly challenging, especially as unilateral action might lead to signiﬁcant effects and costs for others. {WGIII TS.3.1.3, 1.4, 3.3, 6.9, 13.4} 89 Topic 3 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Both adaptation and mitigation can bring substantial co-beneﬁts (medium conﬁdence). Examples of actions with co-beneﬁts include (i) improved air quality (see Figure 3.5); (ii) enhanced energy security, (iii) reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; (iv) sustainable agriculture and forestry; and (v) protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services. {WGII SPM C-1, WGIII SPM.4.1} Strategies and actions can be pursued now that will move towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable develop- ment, while at the same time helping to improve livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental management (high conﬁdence). Prospects for climate-resilient pathways are related fundamentally to what the world accomplishes with climate change mitigation (high conﬁdence). Since mitigation reduces the rate as well as the magnitude of warming, it also increases the time available for adaptation to a particular level of climate change, potentially by several decades. Delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways in the future. {WGII SPM C-2, 20.2, 20.6.2} 3.5 Interaction among mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development Climate change is a threat to equitable and sustain- able development. Adaptation, mitigation and sus- tainable development are closely related, with poten- tial for synergies and trade-offs. Climate change poses an increasing threat to equitable and sustainable development (high conﬁdence). Some climate-related impacts on development are already being observed. Climate change is a threat multiplier. It exacerbates other threats to social and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor and con- straining possible development paths for all. Development along cur- rent global pathways can contribute to climate risk and vulnerability, further eroding the basis for sustainable development. {WGII SPM B-2, 2.5, 10.9, 13.1–13.3, 20.1, 20.2, 20.6, WGIII SPM.2, 4.2} Aligning climate policy with sustainable development requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation (high conﬁdence). Interaction among adaptation, mitigation and sustainable develop- ment occurs both within and across regions and scales, often in the context of multiple stressors. Some options for responding to climate change could impose risks of other environmental and social costs, have adverse distributional effects and draw resources away from other development priorities, including poverty eradication. {WGII 2.5, 8.4, 9.3, 13.3–13.4, 20.2–20.4, 21.4, 25.9, 26.8, WGIII SPM.2, 4.8, 6.6} Figure 3.5 | Air pollutant emission levels of black carbon (BC) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) by 2050, relative to 2005 (0 = 2005 levels). Baseline scenarios without additional efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beyond those in place today are compared to scenarios with stringent mitigation policies, which are consistent with reaching about 450 to about 500 (430 to 530) ppm CO2-eq concentration levels by 2100. {WGIII SPM.6, TS.14, Figure 6.33} 90 Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development Topic 3 Box 3.4 | Co-beneﬁts and Adverse Side effects A government policy or a measure intended to achieve one objective often affects other objectives, either positively or negatively. For example, mitigation policies can inﬂuence local air quality (see Figure 3.5). When the effects are positive they are called ‘co-beneﬁts’, also referred to as ‘ancillary beneﬁts’. Negative effects are referred to as ‘adverse side effects’. Some measures are labelled ‘no or low regret’ when their co-beneﬁts are sufﬁcient to justify their implementation, even in the absence of immediate direct beneﬁts. Co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects can be measured in monetary or non-monetary units. The effect of co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects from climate policies on overall social welfare has not yet been quantitatively examined, with the exception of a few recent multi-objective studies. Many of these have not been well quantiﬁed, and effects can be case and site-speciﬁc as they will depend on local circumstances. {WGII 11.9, 16.3.1, 17.2, 20.4.1, WGIII Box TS.11, 3.6, 5.7} Co-beneﬁts of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives, such as those related to energy security, air qual- ity, efforts to address ecosystem impacts, income distribution, labour supply and employment and urban sprawl (see Table 4.2 and Table 4.5). In the absence of complementary policies, however, some mitigation measures may have adverse side effects (at least in the short term), for example on biodiversity, food security, energy access, economic growth and income distribu- tion. The co-beneﬁts of adaptation policies may include improved access to infrastructure and services, extended education and health systems, reduced disaster losses, better governance and others. {WGII 4.4.4, 11.9, 15.2, 17.2, 20.3.3, 20.4.1, WGIII Box TS.11, 6.6} Comprehensive strategies in response to climate change that are consistent with sustainable development take into account the co-beneﬁts, adverse side effects and risks that may arise from both adaptation and mitigation options. The assessment of overall social welfare impacts is complicated by this interaction between climate change response options and pre- existing non-climate policies. For example, in terms of air quality, the value of the extra tonne of sulfur dioxide (SO2) reduction that occurs with climate change mitigation through reduced fossil fuel combustion depends greatly on the stringency of SO2 control policies. If SO2 policy is weak, the value of SO2 reductions may be large, but if SO2 policy is stringent, it may be near zero. Similarly, in terms of adaptation and disaster risk management, weak policies can lead to an adaptation deﬁcit that increases human and economic losses from natural climate variability. ‘Adaptation deﬁcit’ refers to the lack of capacity to manage adverse impacts of current climate vari- ability. An existing adaptation deﬁcit increases the beneﬁts of adaptation policies that improve the management of climate variability and change. {WGII 20.4.1, WGIII Box TS.11, 6.3} n o i t c u d o r t n I 3 91 3 4 Adaptation and Mitigation n o i t c u d o r t n I 93 Topic 4 Adaptation and Mitigation Topic 4: Adaptation and Mitigation Many adaptation and mitigation options can help address climate change, but no single option is sufﬁcient by itself. Effective implementation depends on policies and cooperation at all scales and can be enhanced through integrated responses that link mitigation and adaptation with other societal objectives. Topic 3 demonstrates the need and strategic considerations for both adaptation and global-scale mitigation to manage risks from climate change. Building on these insights, Topic 4 presents near-term response options that could help achieve such strategic goals. Near-term adaptation and mitigation actions will differ across sectors and regions, reﬂecting development status, response capacities and near- and long-term aspirations with regard to both climate and non-climate outcomes. Because adaptation and mitigation inevitably take place in the context of multiple objectives, particular attention is given to the ability to develop and implement integrated approaches that can build on co-beneﬁts and manage trade-offs. 4.1 Common enabling factors and constraints for adaptation and mitigation responses Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned by common enabling factors. These include effective institutions and governance, innovation and invest- ments in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods and behavioural and lifestyle choices. Innovation and investments in environmentally sound infra- structure and technologies can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhance resilience to climate change (very high conﬁdence). Innovation and change can expand the availability and/ or effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options. For example, investments in low-carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies can reduce the energy intensity of economic development, the carbon intensity of energy, GHG emissions, and the long-term costs of mit- igation. Similarly, new technologies and infrastructure can increase the resilience of human systems while reducing adverse impacts on natural systems. Investments in technology and infrastructure rely on an enabling policy environment, access to ﬁnance and technology and broader economic development that builds capacity (Table 4.1, Section 4.4). {WGII SPM C-2, Table SPM.1, Table TS.8, WGIII SPM.4.1, Table SPM.2, TS.3.1.1, TS 3.1.2, TS.3.2.1} 4 Adaptation and mitigation are constrained by the inertia of global and regional trends in economic development, GHG emis- sions, resource consumption, infrastructure and settlement pat- terns, institutional behaviour and technology (medium evidence, high agreement). Such inertia may limit the capacity to reduce GHG emissions, remain below particular climate thresholds or avoid adverse impacts (Table 4.1). Some constraints may be overcome through new technologies, ﬁnancial resources, increased institutional effectiveness and governance or changes in social and cultural attitudes and behav- iours. {WGII SPM C-1, WGIII SPM.3, SPM.4.2, Table SPM.2} Vulnerability to climate change, GHG emissions, and the capac- ity for adaptation and mitigation are strongly inﬂuenced by livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Table 4.1). Shifts toward more energy-intensive 94 lifestyles can contribute to higher energy and resource consumption, driving greater energy production and GHG emissions and increasing mitigation costs. In contrast, emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns (see 4.3 for details). The social acceptability and/or effectiveness of climate policies are inﬂu- enced by the extent to which they incentivize or depend on regionally appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours. Similarly, livelihoods that depend on climate-sensitive sectors or resources may be par- ticularly vulnerable to climate change and climate change policies. Economic development and urbanization of landscapes exposed to climate hazards may increase the exposure of human settlements and reduce the resilience of natural systems. {WGII SPM A-2, SPM B-2, Table SPM.1, TS A-1, TS A-2, TS C-1, TS C-2, 16.3.2.7, WGIII SPM.4.2, TS.2.2, 4.2} For many regions and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation essential for manag- ing climate change risks (high conﬁdence). Such capacities are place- and context-speciﬁc and therefore there is no single approach for reducing risk that is appropriate across all settings. For example, developing nations with low income levels have the lowest ﬁnan- cial, technological and institutional capacities to pursue low-carbon, climate-resilient development pathways. Although developed nations generally have greater relative capacity to manage the risks of climate change, such capacity does not necessarily trans- late into the implementation of adaptation and mitigation options. {WGII SPM B-1, SPM B-2, TS B-1, TS B-2, 16.3.1.1, 16.3.2, 16.5, WGIII SPM.5.1, TS.4.3, TS.4.5, 4.6} Improving institutions as well as enhancing coordination and cooperation in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation, adaptation and disas- ter risk reduction (very high conﬁdence). Despite the presence of a wide array of multilateral, national and sub-national institu- tions focused on adaptation and mitigation, global GHG emissions continue to increase and identified adaptation needs have not been adequately addressed. The implementation of effective adap- tation and mitigation options may necessitate new institutions and institutional arrangements that span multiple scales (medium conﬁdence) (Table 4.1). {WGII SPM B-2, TS C-1, 16.3.2.4, 16.8, WGIII SPM.4.2.5, SPM.5.1, SPM.5.2, TS.1, TS.3.1.3, TS.4.1, TS.4.2, TS.4.4} Adaptation and Mitigation Topic 4 4.2 Response options for adaptation Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation and potential to reduce climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions. involve signiﬁcant Some adaptation responses co-beneﬁts, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will increase challenges for many adaptation options. People, governments and the private sector are starting to adapt to a changing climate. Since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), understanding of response options has increased, with improved knowledge of their beneﬁts, costs and links to sus- tainable development. Adaptation can take a variety of approaches depending on its context in vulnerability reduction, disaster risk man- agement or proactive adaptation planning. These include (see Table 4.2 for examples and details): • Social, ecological asset and infrastructure development • Technological process optimization • • • Financial services, including risk transfer • Integrated natural resources management Institutional, educational and behavioural change or reinforcement Information systems to support early warning and proactive planning 4 There is increasing recognition of the value of social (including local and indigenous), institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints to adaptation. Effective strategies and actions consider the potential for co-beneﬁts and opportunities within wider strategic goals and development plans. {WGII SPM A-2, SPM C-1, TS A-2, 6.4, 8.3, 9.4, 15.3} Opportunities to enable adaptation planning and implementation exist in all sectors and regions, with diverse potential and approaches depending on context. The need for adaptation along with asso- ciated challenges is expected to increase with climate change (very high conﬁdence). Examples of key adaptation approaches for particular sectors, including constraints and limits, are summarized below. {WGII SPM B, SPM C, 16.4, 16.6, 17.2, 19.6, 19.7, Table 16.3} 95 Topic 4 Adaptation and Mitigation Table 4.2 | Approaches for managing the risks of climate change through adaptation. These approaches should be considered overlapping rather than discrete, and they are often 96 Adaptation and Mitigation Topic 4 Freshwater resources Adaptive water management techniques, including scenario planning, learning-based approaches and ﬂexible and low-regret solutions, can help adjust to uncertain hydrological changes due to climate change and their impacts (limited evidence, high agreement). Strategies include adopting integrated water man- agement, augmenting supply, reducing the mismatch between water supply and demand, reducing non-climate stressors, strengthening institutional capacities and adopting more water-efﬁcient technologies and water-saving strategies. {WGII SPM B-2, Assessment Box SPM.2 Table 1, SPM B-3, 3.6, 22.3–22.4, 23.4, 23.7, 24.4, 27.2–27.3, Box 25-2} Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems Management actions can reduce but not eliminate risks of impacts to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems due to climate change (high conﬁdence). Actions include maintenance of genetic diversity, assisted species migration and dispersal, manipulation of disturbance regimes (e.g., ﬁres, ﬂoods) and reduction of other stressors. Management options that reduce non-climatic stressors, such as habitat modiﬁcation, overexploitation, pollution and invasive species, increase the inherent capacity of ecosystems and their species to adapt to a changing climate. Other options include improving early warning systems and associated response systems. Enhanced connec- tivity of vulnerable ecosystems may also assist autonomous adapta- tion. Translocation of species is controversial and is expected to become less feasible where whole ecosystems are at risk. {WGII SPM B-2, SPM B-3, Figure SPM.5, Table TS.8, 4.4, 25.6, 26.4, Box CC-RF} Coastal systems and low-lying areas Increasingly, coastal adaptation options include those based on integrated coastal zone management, local community partici- pation, ecosystems-based approaches and disaster risk reduc- tion, mainstreamed into relevant strategies and management plans (high conﬁdence). The analysis and implementation of coastal adaptation has progressed more signiﬁcantly in developed countries than in developing countries (high conﬁdence). The relative costs of coastal adaptation are expected to vary strongly among and within regions and countries. {WGII SPM B-2, SPM B-3, 5.5, 8.3, 22.3, 24.4, 26.8, Box 25-1} Marine systems and oceans Marine forecasting and early warning systems as well as reduc- ing non-climatic stressors have the potential to reduce risks for some ﬁsheries and aquaculture industries, but options for unique ecosystems such as coral reefs are limited (high conﬁdence). Fisheries and some aquaculture industries with high-technology and/or large investments have high capacities for adaptation due to greater development of environmental monitoring, modelling and resource assessments. Adaptation options include large-scale translo- cation of industrial ﬁshing activities and ﬂexible management that can react to variability and change. For smaller-scale ﬁsheries and nations with limited adaptive capacities, building social resilience, alternative livelihoods and occupational ﬂexibility are important strategies. Adap- tation options for coral reef systems are generally limited to reduc- ing other stressors, mainly by enhancing water quality and limiting pressures from tourism and ﬁshing, but their efﬁcacy will be severely reduced as thermal stress and ocean acidiﬁcation increase. {WGII SPM B-2, SPM Assessment Box SPM.2 Table 1, TS B-2, 5.5, 6.4, 7.5, 25.6.2, 29.4, 30.6-7, Box CC-MB, Box CC-CR} Food production system/Rural areas Adaptation options for agriculture include technological responses, enhancing smallholder access to credit and other critical production resources, strengthening institutions at local to regional levels and improving market access through trade reform (medium conﬁdence). Responses to decreased food pro- duction and quality include: developing new crop varieties adapted to changes in CO2, temperature, and drought; enhancing the capacity for climate risk management; and offsetting economic impacts of land use change. Improving ﬁnancial support and investing in the production of small-scale farms can also provide beneﬁts. Expanding agricultural mar- kets and improving the predictability and reliability of the world trad- ing system could result in reduced market volatility and help manage food supply shortages caused by climate change. {WGII SPM B-2, SPM B-3, 7.5, 9.3, 22.4, 22.6, 25.9, 27.3} Urban areas/Key economic sectors and services Urban adaptation beneﬁts from effective multi-level govern- ance, alignment of policies and incentives, strengthened local government and community adaptation capacity, synergies with the private sector and appropriate ﬁnancing and institu- tional development (medium conﬁdence). Enhancing the capacity of low-income groups and vulnerable communities and their partner- ships with local governments can also be an effective urban climate adaptation strategy. Examples of adaptation mechanisms include large-scale public-private risk reduction initiatives and economic diver- siﬁcation and government insurance for the non-diversiﬁable portion of risk. In some locations, especially at the upper end of projected cli- mate changes, responses could also require transformational changes such as managed retreat. {WGII SPM B-2, 8.3–8.4, 24.4, 24.5, 26.8, Box 25-9} Human health, security and livelihoods Adaptation options that focus on strengthening existing deliv- ery systems and institutions, as well as insurance and social pro- tection strategies, can improve health, security and livelihoods in the near term (high conﬁdence). The most effective vulnerability reduction measures for health in the near term are programmes that implement and improve basic public health measures such as provision of clean water and sanitation, secure essential health care including vaccination and child health services, increase capacity for disaster pre- paredness and response and alleviate poverty (very high conﬁdence). Options to address heat related mortality include health warning sys- tems linked to response strategies, urban planning and improvements to the built environment to reduce heat stress. Robust institutions can manage many transboundary impacts of climate change to reduce risk of conﬂicts over shared natural resources. Insurance programmes, social protection measures and disaster risk management may enhance long-term livelihood resilience among the poor and marginalized people, if policies address multi-dimensional poverty. {WGII SPM B-2, SPM B-3, 8.2, 10.8, 11.7–11.8, 12.5–12.6, 22.3, 23.9, 25.8, 26.6, Box CC-HS} n o i t c u d o r t n I 4 97 4 Signiﬁcant co-beneﬁts, synergies and trade-offs exist between adaptation and mitigation and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions and sectors (very high conﬁdence). For example, investments in crop varieties adapted to climate change can increase the capacity to cope with drought, and public health measures to address vector-borne diseases can enhance the capacity of health sys- tems to address other challenges. Similarly, locating infrastructure away from low-lying coastal areas helps settlements and eco- systems adapt to sea level rise while also protecting against tsunamis. However, some adaptation options may have adverse side effects that imply real or perceived trade-offs with other adaptation objectives (see Table 4.3 for examples), mitigation objectives or broader development goals. For example, while pro- tection of ecosystems can assist adaptation to climate change and enhance carbon storage, increased use of air conditioning to maintain thermal comfort in buildings or the use of desalination to enhance water resource security can increase energy demand, and therefore, GHG emissions. {WGII SPM B-2, SPM C-1, 5.4.2, 16.3.2.9, 17.2.3.1, Table 16-2} 4.3 Response options for mitigation Mitigation options are available in every major sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emis- sions and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors. A broad range of sectoral mitigation options is available that can reduce GHG emission intensity, improve energy intensity through enhancements of technology, behaviour, production and resource efﬁciency and enable structural changes or changes in activity. In addition, direct options in agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) involve reducing CO2 emissions by reducing deforestation, forest degradation and forest ﬁres; storing carbon in terrestrial systems (for example, through afforestation); and provid- ing bioenergy feedstocks. Options to reduce non-CO2 emissions exist across all sectors but most notably in agriculture, energy supply and 98 Figure 4.1 | Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by sector and total non-CO2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Kyoto gases) across sectors in baseline (left panel) and mitigation scenarios that reach about 450 (430 to 480) ppm CO2-eq (likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS, middle panel) and without CCS (right panel). Light yellow background denotes direct CO2 and non-CO2 GHG emissions for both the baseline and mitigation scenarios. In addition, for the baseline scenarios, the sum of direct and indirect emissions from the energy end-use sectors (transport, buildings and industry) is also shown (dark yellow background). Mitigation scenarios show direct emissions only. However, mitigation in the end-use sectors leads also to indirect emissions reductions in the upstream energy supply sector. Direct emissions of the end- use sectors thus do not include the emission reduction potential at the supply-side due to, for example, reduced electricity demand. Note that for calculating the indirect emissions only electricity emissions are allocated from energy supply to end-use sectors. The numbers at the bottom of the graphs refer to the number of scenarios included in the range, which differs across sectors and time due to different sectoral resolution and time horizon of models. Note that many models cannot reach concentrations of about 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 in the absence of CCS, resulting in a low number of scenarios for the right panel. Negative emissions in the electricity sector are due to the application of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS). ‘Net’ agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions consider afforestation, reforestation as well as deforestation activities. {WGIII Figure SPM.7, Figure TS.15} industry. An overview of sectoral mitigation options and potentials is provided in Table 4.4. {WGIII TS 3.2.1} of the world’s urban areas will be developed during this period. {WGIII SPM.4.2, TS.3.2} Well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strate- gies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions than a focus on individual technologies and sectors with efforts in one sector affecting the need for mitigation in others (medium conﬁdence). In baseline scenarios without new mitigation policies, GHG emissions are projected to grow in all sectors, except for net CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector (Figure 4.1, left panel). Mitigation sce- narios reaching around 450 ppm CO2-eq4227 concentration by 210043 28 (likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) show large- scale global changes in the energy supply sector (Figure 4.1, middle and right panel). While rapid decarbonization of energy supply gen- erally entails more ﬂexibility for end-use and AFOLU sectors, stronger demand reductions lessen the mitigation challenge for the supply side of the energy system (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). There are thus strong inter- dependencies across sectors and the resulting distribution of the miti- gation effort is strongly inﬂuenced by the availability and performance of future technologies, particularly BECCS and large scale afforestation (Figure 4.1, middle and right panel). The next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas, as a large portion Decarbonizing (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity of) electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies in achieving low stabilization levels (of about 450 to about 500 ppm CO2-eq, at least about as likely as not to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) (medium evi- dence, high agreement). In most integrated modelling scenarios, decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in the industry, buildings and transport sectors. In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below 2010 levels between 2040 and 2070. {WGIII SPM.4.2, 6.8, 7.11} 4 Efﬁciency enhancements and behavioural changes, in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising development, are a key mitigation strategy in scenarios reaching atmospheric CO2-eq concentrations of about 450 to about 500 ppm by 2100 (robust evidence, high agree- ment). Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important 42 See Glossary for deﬁnition of CO2-eq concentrations and emissions; also Box 3.2 for metrics to calculate the CO2-equivalence of non-CO2 emissions and their inﬂuence on sectoral abatement strategies. 43 For comparison, the CO2-eq concentration in 2011 is estimated to be 430 [340 to 520] ppm. 99 1004element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more ﬂexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infra- structures and are associated with important co-beneﬁts (Figure 4.2, Table 4.4). Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns (e.g., mobility demand and mode, energy use in households, choice of longer-lasting products) and dietary change and reduction in food wastes. A number of options including monetary and non-monetary incentives as well as information measures may facili-tate behavioural changes. {WGIII SPM.4.2}Decarbonization of the energy supply sector (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity) requires upscaling of low- and zero-carbon electricity generation technologies (high conﬁdence). In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios (about 450 to about 500 ppm CO2-eq , at least about as likely as not to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels), the share of low-carbon electricity supply (comprising renewable energy (RE), nuclear and CCS, includ-ing BECCS) increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050 and 90% by 2100, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by 2100. Among these low-carbon technologies, a growing number of RE technologies have achieved a level of maturity to enable deployment at signiﬁcant scale since AR4 (robust evidence, high agreement) and nuclear energy is a mature low-GHG emission source of baseload power, but its share of global electricity generation has been declining (since 1993). GHG emissions from energy supply can be reduced signiﬁcantly by replacing current world average coal-ﬁred power plants with modern, highly efﬁ-cient natural gas combined-cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated. {WGIII SPM.4.2}Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable inﬂuence on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change (medium evidence, medium agreement). In the transport sector, technical and behavioural mitiga-tion measures for all modes, plus new infrastructure and urban rede-velopment investments, could reduce ﬁnal energy demand signiﬁcantly below baseline levels (robust evidence, medium agreement) (Table 4.4). While opportunities for switching to low-carbon fuels exist, the rate of decarbonization in the transport sector might be constrained by challenges associated with energy storage and the relatively low 4321High energy demand scenariosshow higher levelsof oil supply. In high energy demand scenarios, alternativeliquid and hydrogen technologies are scaledup more rapidly. High energy demand scenarios showa more rapid up-scaling of CCStechnologies but a more rapid phase-out of unabated fossil fuel conversiontechnologies. In high energy demand scenarios non-fossil electricity generation technologies are scaled up more rapidly. Figure 4.2 | Inﬂuence of energy demand on the deployment of energy supply technologies in 2050 in mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 to about 500 ppm CO2-eq con-centrations by 2100 (at least about as likely as not to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels). Blue bars for ‘low energy demand’ show the deployment range of scenarios with limited growth in ﬁnal energy demand of <20% in 2050 compared to 2010. Red bars show the deployment range of technologies in a case of ‘high energy demand’ (>20% growth in 2050 compared to 2010). For each technology, the median, interquartile and full deployment range is displayed. Notes: Scenarios assuming technology restrictions are excluded.

In the building sector, recent advances in technologies, know-how and policies provide opportunities to stabilize or reduce global energy use to about current levels by mid-century. In addition, recent improve- ments in performance and costs make very low energy construction and retroﬁts of buildings economically attractive, sometimes even at net negative costs (robust evidence, high agreement). In the industry sector, improvements in GHG emission efﬁciency and in the efﬁciency of material use, recycling and reuse of materials and products, and overall reductions in product demand (e.g., through a more intensive use of products) and service demand could, in addition to energy efﬁ- ciency, help reduce GHG emissions below the baseline level. Prevalent approaches for promoting energy efﬁciency in industry include infor- mation programmes followed by economic instruments, regulatory approaches and voluntary actions. Important options for mitigation in waste management are waste reduction, followed by re-use, recy- cling and energy recovery (robust evidence, high agreement). {WGIII SPM.4.2, Box TS.12, TS.3.2} The most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing deforestation, with large differences in their relative impor- tance across regions. In agriculture, the most cost-effective mit- igation options are cropland management, grazing land man- agement and restoration of organic soils (medium evidence, high agreement). About a third of mitigation potential in forestry can be achieved at a cost <20 USD/tCO2-eq emission. Demand-side measures, such as changes in diet and reductions of losses in the food supply chain, have a signiﬁcant, but uncertain, potential to reduce GHG emissions from food production (medium evidence, medium agreement). {WGIII SPM 4.2.4} Bioenergy can play a critical role for mitigation, but there are issues to consider, such as the sustainability of practices and the efﬁciency of bioenergy systems (robust evidence, medium agreement). Evidence suggests that bioenergy options with low life- cycle emissions, some already available, can reduce GHG emissions; outcomes are site-speciﬁc and rely on efﬁcient integrated ‘biomass- to-bioenergy systems’, and sustainable land use management and governance. Barriers to large-scale deployment of bioenergy include concerns about GHG emissions from land, food security, water resources, biodiversity conservation and livelihoods. {WGIII SPM.4.2} 4 Mitigation measures intersect with other societal goals, cre- ating the possibility of co-beneﬁts or adverse side-effects. These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking climate mitigation actions (robust evidence, medium agreement). Mitigation can positively or negatively inﬂu- ence the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development (see also Section 4.5). On the other hand, policies towards other societal goals can inﬂuence the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives. These inﬂuences can be substantial, although sometimes difﬁcult to quantify, especially in welfare terms. This multi-objective perspective is important in part because it helps to identify areas where support for policies that advance multiple goals will be robust. Potential co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects of the main sectoral 102 mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4.5. Overall, the potential for co-beneﬁts for energy end-use measures outweigh the potential for adverse side effects, whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and AFOLU measures. {WGIII SPM.2} 4.4 Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and ﬁnance Effective adaptation and mitigation responses will depend on policies and measures across multiple scales: international, regional, national and sub-national. Policies across all scales supporting technology devel- opment, diffusion and transfer, as well as ﬁnance for responses to climate change, can complement and enhance the effectiveness of policies that directly pro- mote adaptation and mitigation. 4.4.1 International and regional cooperation on adaptation and mitigation Because climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale (see 3.1), effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently, even though mitigation can also have local co-beneﬁts. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate change issues. While adaptation focuses primarily on local to national scale outcomes, its effectiveness can be enhanced through coordina- tion across governance scales, including international cooperation. In fact, international cooperation has helped to facilitate the creation of adaptation strategies, plans, and actions at national, sub-national, and local levels. A variety of climate policy instruments have been employed, and even more could be employed, at international and regional levels to address mitigation and to support and promote adaptation at national and sub-national scales. Evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation. {WGII SPM C-1, 2.2, 15.2, WGIII 13.ES, 14.3, 15.8, SREX SPM, 7.ES} The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the main multilateral forum focused on address- ing climate change, with nearly universal participation. UNFCCC activities since 2007, which include the 2010 Cancún Agreements and the 2011 Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, have sought to enhance actions under the Convention, and have led to an increas- ing number of institutions and other arrangements for international climate change cooperation. Other institutions organized at different levels of governance have resulted in diversifying international climate change cooperation. {WGIII SPM.5.2, 13.5} Existing and proposed international climate change coopera- tion arrangements vary in their focus and degree of centrali- zation and coordination. They span: multilateral agreements, har- monized national policies and decentralized but coordinated national policies, as well as regional and regionally-coordinated policies (see Figure 4.3). {WGIII SPM.5.2} Table 4.5 | Potential co-beneﬁts (blue text) and adverse side effects (red text) of the main sectoral mitigation measures. Co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects, and their overall positive or negative effect, all depend on local circumstances as well as on the implementation practice, pace and scale.

Inclusion of adaptation is increasingly important to reduce the risk from climate change impacts and may engage a greater number of countries. {WGIII 13.2, 13.3.3, 13.5.1.1, 13.14} The Kyoto Protocol offers lessons towards achieving the ulti- mate objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with respect to par- ticipation, implementation, ﬂexibility mechanisms, and environ- mental effectiveness (medium evidence, low agreement). The Protocol was the ﬁrst binding step toward implementing the princi- ples and goals provided by the UNFCCC. According to national GHG inventories through 2012 submitted to the UNFCCC by October 2013, Annex B Parties with quantiﬁed emission limitations (and reduction obligations) in aggregate may have bettered their collective emission reduction target in the ﬁrst commitment period,4429 but some emissions reductions that would have occurred even in its absence were also counted. The Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) created a market for emissions offsets from developing countries, the purpose being two-fold: to help Annex I countries fulﬁll their commitments and to assist non-Annex I countries achieve sustainable development. The CDM generated Certiﬁed Emission Reductions (offsets) equivalent to emissions of over 1.4 GtCO2-eq4242 by October 2013, led to signiﬁcant project investments, and generated investment ﬂows for a variety of functions, including the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund. However, its envi- ronmental effectiveness has been questioned by some, particularly 44 The ﬁnal conclusion regarding compliance of Annex B Parties remains subject to the review process under the Kyoto Protocol as of October 2014. 105 Topic 4 Adaptation and Mitigation in regard to its early years, due to concerns about the additionality of projects (that is, whether projects bring about emissions that are different from business as usual (BAU) circumstances), the validity of baselines, and the possibility of emissions leakage (medium evidence, medium agreement). Such concerns about additionality are common to any emission-reduction-credit (offset) program, and are not speciﬁc to the CDM. Due to market forces, the majority of single CDM projects have been concentrated in a limited number of countries, while Pro- grammes of Activities, though less frequent, have been more evenly distributed. In addition, the Kyoto Protocol created two other ‘ﬂexibility mechanisms’: Joint Implementation and International Emissions Trad- ing. {WGIII SPM.5.2, Table TS.9, 13.7, 13.13.1.1, 14.3} Several conceptual models for effort-sharing have been iden- tiﬁed in research. However, realized distributional impacts from actual international cooperative agreements depend not only on the approach taken but also on criteria applied to operationalize equity and the manner in which developing countries’ emissions reduction plans are ﬁnanced. {WGIII 4.6, 13.4} Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national cli- mate policies offer potential climate change mitigation ben- eﬁts (medium evidence, medium agreement). Linkages have been established between carbon markets and in principle could also be established between and among a heterogeneous set of policy instruments including non-market-based policies, such as perfor- mance standards. Potential advantages include lower mitigation costs, decreased emission leakage and increased market liquidity. {WGIII SPM.5.2, 13.3, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7, 14.5} Regional initiatives between national and global scales are being developed and implemented, but their impact on global mitigation has been limited to date (medium conﬁdence). Some climate policies could be more environmentally and economically effective if implemented across broad regions, such as by embodying mitigation objectives in trade agreements or jointly constructing infra- structures that facilitate reduction in carbon emissions. {WGIII Table TS.9, 13.13, 14.4, 14.5} International cooperation for supporting adaptation planning and implementation has assisted in the creation of adaptation strategies, plans and actions at national, sub-national and local levels (high conﬁdence). For example, a range of multilateral and regionally targeted funding mechanisms have been established for adaptation; UN agencies, international development organizations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have provided information, methodologies and guidelines; and global and regional initiatives sup- ported and promoted the creation of national adaptation strategies in both developing and developed countries. Closer integration of disas- ter risk reduction and climate change adaptation at the international level, and the mainstreaming of both into international development assistance, may foster greater efﬁciency in the use of resources and capacity. However, stronger efforts at the international level do not necessarily lead to substantive and rapid results at the local level. {WGII 15.2, 15.3, SREX SPM, 7.4, 8.2, 8.5} 4.4.2 National and sub-national policies 4.4.2.1 Adaptation Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the public and private sector and within communities (high conﬁ- dence). Adaptation options adopted to date (see Table 4.6) emphasize incremental adjustments and co-beneﬁts and are starting to emphasize ﬂexibility and learning (medium evidence, medium agreement). Most assessments of adaptation have been restricted to impacts, vulnerabil- ity and adaptation planning, with very few assessing the processes of implementation or the effects of adaptation actions (medium evidence, high agreement). {WGII SPM A-2, TS A-2} Adaptation and Mitigation Topic 4 National governments play key roles in adaptation planning and implementation (robust evidence, high agreement). There has been substantial progress since the AR4 in the development of national adaptation strategies and plans. This includes National Adap- tation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) by least developed countries, the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process, and strategic frameworks for national adaptation in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversiﬁca- tion, and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and ﬁnancial support. {WGII SPM C-1, 15.2} While local government and the private sector have different functions, which vary regionally, they are increasingly recog- nized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil soci- ety and in managing risk information and ﬁnancing (medium evidence, high agreement). There is a signiﬁcant increase in the number of planned adaptation responses at the local level in rural and urban communities of developed and developing countries since the AR4. However, local councils and planners are often confronted by the complexity of adaptation without adequate access to guiding infor- mation or data on local vulnerabilities and potential impacts. Steps for mainstreaming adaptation into local decision-making have been iden- tiﬁed but challenges remain in their implementation. Hence, scholars stress the important role of linkages with national and sub-national levels of government as well as partnerships among public, civic and private sectors in implementing local adaptation responses. {WGII SPM A-2, SPM C-1, 14.2, 15.2} Institutional dimensions of adaptation governance, including the integration of adaptation into planning and decision-making, play a key role in promoting the transition from planning to implementation of adaptation (robust evidence, high agree- ment). The most commonly emphasized institutional barriers or ena- blers for adaptation planning and implementation are: 1) multilevel institutional co-ordination between different political and administra- tive levels in society; 2) key actors, advocates and champions initiating, mainstreaming and sustaining momentum for climate adaptation; 3) horizontal interplay between sectors, actors and policies operating at similar administrative levels; 4) political dimensions in planning and implementation; and 5) coordination between formal governmen- tal, administrative agencies and private sectors and stakeholders to increase efﬁciency, representation and support for climate adaptation measures. {WGII 15.2, 15.5, 16.3, Box 15-1} Existing and emerging economic instruments can foster adap- tation by providing incentives for anticipating and reducing impacts (medium conﬁdence). Instruments include public-private ﬁnance partnerships, loans, payments for environmental services, improved resource pricing, charges and subsidies, norms and regula- tions and risk sharing and transfer mechanisms. Risk ﬁnancing mecha- nisms in the public and private sector, such as insurance and risk pools, can contribute to increasing resilience, but without attention to major design challenges, they can also provide disincentives, cause market failure and decrease equity. Governments often play key roles as regu- lators, providers or insurers of last resort. {WGII SPM C-1} 4.4.2.2 Mitigation There has been a considerable increase in national and sub- national mitigation plans and strategies since AR4. In 2012, 67% of global GHG emissions42 were subject to national legislation or strat- egies versus 45% in 2007. However, there has not yet been a substan- tial deviation in global emissions from the past trend. These plans and strategies are in their early stages of development and implementation in many countries, making it difﬁcult to assess their aggregate impact on future global emissions (medium evidence, high agreement). {WGIII SPM.5.1} n o i t c u d o r t n I Since AR4, there has been an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-beneﬁts and reduce adverse side effects (high conﬁdence). Governments often explicitly reference co-beneﬁts in climate and sectoral plans and strategies. {WGIII SPM.5.1} Sector-speciﬁc policies have been more widely used than econ- omy-wide policies (Table 4.7) (medium evidence, high agree- ment). Although most economic theory suggests that economy-wide policies for mitigation would be more cost-effective than sector-speciﬁc policies, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to design and implement than sector-speciﬁc policies. The latter may be better suited to address barriers or market failures speciﬁc to certain sectors and may be bundled in packages of comple- mentary policies {WGIII SPM.5.1} In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run environmental effects of cap and trade sys- tems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining (limited evidence, medium agreement). In some countries, tax-based policies speciﬁcally aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross domestic product (GDP) (high conﬁdence). In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes (although not necessarily designed for the purpose of mitigation) have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes (robust evi- dence, medium agreement). Revenues from carbon taxes or auctioned emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the general principle that mitigation policies that raise government reve- nue generally have lower social costs than approaches which do not. {WGIII SPM.5.1} 4 Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increas- ing number and variety of RE policies including subsidies—motivated by many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years. Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies. Energy access and social and economic development have been the primary drivers in most developing coun- tries whereas secure energy supply and environmental concerns have been most important in developed countries. The focus of policies is 107 Adaptation and Mitigation Topic 4 broadening from a concentration primarily on RE electricity to include RE heating and cooling and transportation. {SRREN SPM.7} energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable develop- ment: {WGIII SPM.2} The reduction of subsidies for GHG-related activities in vari- ous sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic context (high conﬁdence). While subsidies can affect emissions in many sectors, most of the recent literature has focused on subsidies for fossil fuels. Since AR4 a small but growing literature based on economy-wide models has projected that com- plete removal of subsidies to fossil fuels in all countries could result in reductions in global aggregate emissions by mid-century (medium evidence, medium agreement). Studies vary in methodology, the type and deﬁnition of subsidies and the time frame for phase out consid- ered. In particular, the studies assess the impacts of complete removal of all fossil fuel subsides without seeking to assess which subsidies are wasteful and inefﬁcient, keeping in mind national circumstances. {WGIII SPM.5.1} Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often environmentally effective (medium evi- dence, medium agreement). Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efﬁciency standards; examples of information pro- grammes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions. {WGIII SPM.5.1} Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce rev- enues for fossil fuel exporters, but differences between regions and fuels exist (high conﬁdence). Most mitigation scenarios are associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major exporters. The effect on natural gas export revenues is more uncertain. The availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effect of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel assets (medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM.5.1} Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be syn- ergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions (medium evidence, high agreement). For instance, a carbon tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for the supply of RE. By contrast, if a cap and trade system has a sufﬁciently stringent cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies have no further impact on reducing emissions (although they may affect costs and possibly the viability of more stringent future targets) (medium evidence, high agreement). In either case, additional policies may be needed to address market failures relating to innovation and technology diffusion. {WGIII SPM.5.1} Sub-national climate policies are increasingly prevalent, both in countries with national policies and in those without. These policies include state and provincial climate plans combining market, regulatory and information instruments, and sub-national cap-and-trade systems. In addition, transnational cooperation has arisen among sub-national actors, notably among institutional investors, NGOs seeking to govern carbon offset markets, and networks of cities seek- ing to collaborate in generating low-carbon urban development. {WGIII 13.5.2, 15.2.4, 15.8} Co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, n o i t c u d o r t n I • Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm CO2-equivalent by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy security objectives, with signiﬁcant co-beneﬁts for human health, ecosystem impacts and sufﬁciency of resources and resilience of the energy system. {WGIII SPM.4.1} • Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy ser- vices and could hamper the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services to underserved populations (low con- ﬁdence). These potential adverse side effects can be avoided with the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other beneﬁt transfer mechanisms (medium conﬁdence). The costs of achieving nearly universal access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking and heating are projected to be between USD 72 to 95 billion per year until 2030 with minimal effects on GHG emis- sions (limited evidence, medium agreement) and multiple beneﬁts in health and air pollutant reduction (high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM.5.1} Whether or not side effects materialize, and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-speciﬁc, and depend on local cir- cumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation. Many co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects have not been well-quantiﬁed. {WGIII SPM.4.1} 4.4.3 Technology development and transfer Technology policy (development, diffusion and transfer) com- plements other mitigation policies across all scales from inter- national to sub-national, but worldwide investment in research in support of GHG mitigation is small relative to overall public research spending (high conﬁdence). Technology policy includes technology-push (e.g., publicly-funded R&D) and demand-pull (e.g., governmental procurement programmes). Such policies address a pervasive market failure because, in the absence of government policy such as patent protection, the invention of new technologies and practices from R&D efforts has aspects of a public good and thus tends to be under-provided by market forces alone. Technology support policies have promoted substantial innovation and diffusion of new technologies, but the cost-effectiveness of such policies is often difﬁcult to assess. Technology policy can increase incentives for participation and compliance with international cooperative efforts, particularly in the long run. {WGIII SPM.5.1, 2.6.5, 3.11, 13.9, 13.12, 15.6.5} 4 Many adaptation efforts also critically rely on diffusion and transfer of technologies and management practices, but their effective use depends on a suitable institutional, regulatory, social and cultural context (high conﬁdence). Adaptation tech- nologies are often familiar and already applied elsewhere. However, the success of technology transfer may involve not only the provision of ﬁnance and information, but also strengthening of policy and reg- ulatory environments and capacities to absorb, employ and improve technologies appropriate to local circumstances. {WGII 15.4} 109 Figure 4.4 | Change in annual investment ﬂows from the average baseline level over the next two decades (2010 to 2029) for mitigation scenarios that stabilize concentrations (without overshoot) within the range of approximately 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 2100. Total electricity generation (leftmost column) is the sum of renewable and nuclear energy, power plants with CCS, and fossil-fuel power plants without CCS. The vertical bars indicate the range between the minimum and maximum estimate; the horizontal bar indicates the median. The numbers in the bottom row show the total number of studies in the literature used in the assessment. Individual technologies shown are found to be used in dif- ferent model scenarios in either a complementary or a synergistic way, depending largely on technology-speciﬁc assumptions and the timing and ambition level of the phase-in of global climate policies. {WGIII Figure SPM.9} 4.4.4 Investment and ﬁnance 4 Substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes in investment patterns (high conﬁdence). Mitigation scenarios in which policies stabilize atmospheric concentrations (without over- shoot) in the range from 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 21004530 lead to sub- stantial shifts in annual investment ﬂows during the period 2010–2029 compared to baseline scenarios. Over the next two decades (2010– 2029), annual investments in conventional fossil fuel technologies associated with the electricity supply sector are projected to decline in the scenarios by about USD 30 (2 to 166) billion (median: –20% com- pared to 2010) while annual investment in low carbon electricity supply (i.e., renewables, nuclear and electricity with CCS) is projected to rise in the scenarios by about USD 147 (31 to 360) billion (median: +100% compared to 2010) (limited evidence, medium agreement). In addition, annual incremental energy efﬁciency investments in transport, industry and buildings is projected to rise in the scenarios by about USD 336 (1 to 641) billion. Global total annual investment in the energy system is presently about USD 1,200 billion. This number includes only energy supply of electricity and heat and respective upstream and downstream activities. Energy efﬁciency investment or underlying sector investment is not included (Figure 4.4). {WGIII SPM.5.1, 16.2} There is no widely agreed deﬁnition of what constitutes climate ﬁnance, but estimates of the ﬁnancial ﬂows associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation are available. See Figure 4.5 for an overview of climate ﬁnance ﬂows. Published assess- ments of all current annual ﬁnancial ﬂows whose expected effect is to reduce net GHG emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate change and climate variability show USD 343 to 385 billion per year 45 This range comprises scenarios that reach 430 to 480 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 (likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) and scenarios that reach 480 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 (without overshoot: more likely than not to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels). 110 investment by improving the return adjusted for the risk for private actors. Public-private risk reduction initiatives (such as in the context of insurance systems) and economic diversiﬁcation are examples of adaptation action enabling and relying on private sector participation. {WGII SPM B-2, SPM C-1, WGIII SPM.5.1} Financial resources for adaptation have become available more slowly than for mitigation in both developed and devel- oping countries. Limited evidence indicates that there is a gap between global adaptation needs and the funds available for adaptation (medium conﬁdence). Potential synergies between international ﬁnance for disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change have not yet been fully realized (high conﬁdence). There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation costs, fund- ing and investment. Studies estimating the global cost of adaptation are characterized by shortcomings in data, methods and coverage (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C-1, 14.2, SREX SPM} 4 globally (medium conﬁdence). Out of this, total public climate ﬁnance that ﬂowed to developing countries is estimated to be between USD 35 and 49 billion per year in 2011 and 2012 (medium conﬁdence). Esti- mates of international private climate ﬁnance ﬂowing to developing countries range from USD 10 to 72 billion per year including foreign direct investment as equity and loans in the range of USD 10 to 37 billion per year over the period of 2008–2011 (medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM.5.1} In many countries, the private sector plays central roles in the processes that lead to emissions as well as to mitigation and adaptation. Within appropriate enabling environments, the pri- vate sector, along with the public sector, can play an impor- tant role in ﬁnancing mitigation and adaptation (medium evi- dence, high agreement). The share of total mitigation ﬁnance from the private sector, acknowledging data limitations, is estimated to be on average between two-thirds and three-fourths on the global level (2010–2012) (limited evidence, medium agreement). In many coun- tries, public ﬁnance interventions by governments and international development banks encourage climate investments by the private sector and provide ﬁnance where private sector investment is limited. The quality of a country’s enabling environment includes the effective- ness of its institutions, regulations and guidelines regarding the pri- vate sector, security of property rights, credibility of policies and other factors that have a substantial impact on whether private ﬁrms invest in new technologies and infrastructures. Dedicated policy instruments and ﬁnancial arrangements, for example, credit insurance, feed-in tar- iffs, concessional ﬁnance or rebates provide an incentive for mitigation 111 Topic 4 Adaptation and Mitigation An integrated approach to energy planning and implementation that explicitly assesses the potential for co-beneﬁts and the presence of adverse side effects can capture complementarities across multiple climate, social and environmental objectives (medium conﬁdence). There are strong interactive effects across various energy policy objectives, such as energy security, air quality, health and energy access (see Figure 3.5) and between a range of social and environmental objectives and climate mitigation objectives (see Table 4.5). An integrated approach can be assisted by tools such as cost-beneﬁt analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-criteria analysis and expected utility theory. It also requires appropriate coordinating institutions. {WGIII Figure SPM.6, TS.1, TS.3} Explicit consideration of interactions among water, food, energy and biological carbon sequestration plays an important role in supporting effective decisions for climate resilient pathways (medium evidence, high agreement). Both biofuel-based power generation and large-scale afforestation designed to mitigate climate change can reduce catchment run-off, which may conﬂict with alter- native water uses for food production, human consumption or the maintenance of ecosystem function and services (see also Box 3.4). Conversely, irrigation can increase the climate resilience of food and ﬁbre production but reduces water availability for other uses. {WGII Box CC-WE, Box TS.9} An integrated response to urbanization provides substantial opportunities for enhanced resilience, reduced emissions and more sustainable development (medium conﬁdence). Urban areas account for more than half of global primary energy use and energy-related CO2 emissions (medium evidence, high agreement) and contain a high proportion of the population and economic activities at risk from climate change. In rapidly growing and urbanizing regions, mitigation strategies based on spatial planning and efﬁcient infrastruc- ture supply can avoid the lock-in of high emission patterns. Mixed-use zoning, transport-oriented development, increased density and co-lo- cated jobs and homes can reduce direct and indirect energy use across sectors. Compact development of urban spaces and intelligent densi- ﬁcation can preserve land carbon stocks and land for agriculture and bioenergy. Reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water are examples of mitigation actions with adaptation beneﬁts. Building resilient infrastructure sys- tems can reduce vulnerability of urban settlements and cities to coastal ﬂooding, sea level rise and other climate-induced stresses. {WGII SPM B-2, SPM C-1, TS B-2, TS C-1, TS C-2, WGIII SPM.4.2.5, TS.3} 4.5 Trade-offs, synergies and integrated responses There are many opportunities to link mitigation, adap- tation and the pursuit of other societal objectives through integrated responses (high conﬁdence). Suc- cessful implementation relies on relevant tools, suit- able governance structures and enhanced capacity to respond (medium conﬁdence). A growing evidence base indicates close links between adaptation and mitigation, their co-beneﬁts and adverse side effects, and recognizes sustainable development as the overarching context for climate policy (see Sections 3.5, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3). Developing tools to address these linkages is critical to the success of climate policy in the context of sustainable development (see also Sections 4.4 and 3.5). This section presents examples of integrated responses in speciﬁc policy arenas, as well as some of the factors that promote or impede policies aimed at multiple objectives. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, encompassing connections among human health, water, energy, land use and biodiversity (very high conﬁdence). Mitigation can support the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human health, food security, environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and sustainable development, although there can also be negative effects. Adaptation measures also have the potential to deliver miti- gation co-beneﬁts, and vice versa, and support other societal goals, though trade-offs can also arise. {WGII SPM C-1, SPM C-2, 8.4, 9.3–9.4, 11.9, Box CC-WE, WGIII Table TS.3, Table TS.4, Table TS.5, Table TS.6, Table TS.7} Integration of adaptation and mitigation into planning and decision-making can create synergies with sustainable develop- ment (high conﬁdence). Synergies and trade-offs among mitigation and adaptation policies and policies advancing other societal goals can be substantial, although sometimes difﬁcult to quantify especially in welfare terms (see also Section 3.5). A multi-objective approach to policy-making can help manage these synergies and trade-offs. Poli- cies advancing multiple goals may also attract greater support. {WGII SPM C-1, SPM C-2, 20.3, WGIII 1.2.1, 3.6.3, 4.3, 4.6, 4.8, 6.6.1} 4 Effective integrated responses depend on suitable tools and gov- ernance structures, as well as adequate capacity (medium conﬁ- dence). Managing trade-offs and synergies is challenging and requires tools to help understand interactions and support decision-making at local and regional scales. Integrated responses also depend on governance that enables coordination across scales and sectors, sup- ported by appropriate institutions. Developing and implementing suitable tools and governance structures often requires upgrading the human and institutional capacity to design and deploy integrated responses. {WGII SPM C-1, SPM C-2, 2.2, 2.4, 15.4, 15.5, 16.3, Table 14-1, Table 16-1, WGIII TS.1, TS.3, 15.2} 112 115 116 117 I I I 2 130 131 135 139 141 143 VI 147 x e n The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change.
